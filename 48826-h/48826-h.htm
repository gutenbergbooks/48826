<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In presenting to you, our third edition of “The Art of
Home Candy Making,” we can safely say, that a more complete
or practical book, on Home Candy Making, cannot be
found. We strive not only to give you a larger variety of
the finest candies that can be made, but to make each recipe,
so thorough and simple that anyone with a little study before
making them, can make every piece in this book with little or
no trouble at all.</p>

<p>In presenting a thermometer with each book and telling
you how to use it, we lessen the work to such an extent, that
when once using one, you would never attempt to make candy
without it. In using a thermometer in candy-making, all it is
necessary for you to do, is to put it down in the kettle in the
boiling candy, and when it registers the required degree, the
candy is done and cannot possibly be wrong.</p>

<p>Every batch you make will be just the same, as we give
you the exact degree to cook every recipe. This book is intended
for those who make candy at home, and does not contain
a single recipe, but that may be made right at home in
your own kitchen with a very small outlay for tools, other
than for cooking material.</p>

<p>We have endeavored to make all things clear to you, but
we must insist that you read each recipe over and study it
carefully before starting to cook, if you wish success.</p>

<p>With this explanation we think you will agree with us
that this is the most complete book on home candy making
ever written.</p>

<p>Hoping you will make a success of your efforts, and with
our assistance in answering all questions you will surely do
so, we remain,</p>

<h2>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h2>


<p>After reading the introduction to this book, you will understand
that it is not written for professional candy-makers,
but for those who make candy at home; and consequently it
is necessary to go into every little detail, which of course, will
make these instructions rather lengthy.</p>

<p>We will endeavor to make them as plain as though we
were holding a personal conversation with you, and explain
to you, how to put the style and finish to each piece of your
home-made candies, that will equal any of the finest grades
of candy that are made today.</p>

<p>In reading these instructions, do not get the idea that
any single one of these recipes are too difficult for you to
make, for you will find they are very simple when once you
have begun.</p>

<p>Any of these may be cut down or increased as you desire,
but always use the same proportions, and cook the batch to
the same degree. Remember, the <b>degree</b> is always the <b>same</b>,
no matter how <b>large or small</b> you make your batches.</p>

<p>Do not think it absolutely necessary to get everything in
the line of tools that we mention in this book, to have success
with your candy, as it is not. For our whole aim is to teach
you how to make your candies with as little expense as possible.
But to those who wish to go into it a little deeper than
others, or who make their candy to sell, it would be well for
them to have as many of these tools as possible, for while not
being a necessity, are a great convenience.</p>

<p>These candies can be made at an average cost of from
eight to fifteen cents per pound for the materials used in
them. In bon-bons the cost is considerably lower than in
chocolates as you will find out.</p>

<p>This chocolate coating you will use for dipping, is very
expensive, but you will find your chocolate creams cost you
about fifteen cents per pound in the end; and they are the
same grade of chocolates that you pay from sixty to eighty
cents per pound for in the best candy shops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no way to cheapen your coating chocolate, but
one pound of chocolate will cover two to three pounds of
candy, according to the kind of candy to be dipped, as some
are heavier than others.</p>

<p>By bon-bons we mean the fancy colored ones with the
fancy centers, and coated with bon-bon cream; not chocolate
coated ones, as we call those chocolate bon-bons.</p>

<p>The cooking question, which is three-fourths of candy-making,
is here solved by the use of the thermometer, which
accompanies this book. By cooking your candy with a thermometer,
you are not only exempt from burning or overcooking
your batches, but your candy will always be exactly
the same; and after you have made the bon-bon cream alone,
you would not take many times the cost of this book for
your thermometer, if you thought you could not procure another.</p>

<p>If at any time you have trouble with any recipe, look and
see if you have followed the instructions exactly as written,
and if you have and it does not act right, drop us a line, enclosing
a stamp for reply, telling us in as few words as possible,
how it acts and where it is not right, and we will write
at once where your trouble is. If one of your batches shows
signs of turning to sugar or gets gritty, simply try it again
and use a little more glucose than called for in the recipe.
But we know that if you follow the instructions and read
every recipe carefully before making it, that you will never
have any trouble, as we make these candies ourselves every
day, and we know that these recipes are correct. Therefore
we repeat, that you must be exact in your weighing and
the degree you cook the batch to, if you wish success.</p>

<p>These candies can be seen at any time, at either of Mr.
Ned. R. Goldberg’s stores in Canton, O.</p>

<p>In giving you the following recipes we will no doubt shatter
a great many ideas that you now have in regard to home
candy making; especially as to the style of cooking, size of
batch, and length of time you keep your fondants after being
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>In making your Christmas candies, commence from three
to four weeks before hand, and make your chocolate creams
first, as they will keep perfectly for that length of time, and
even longer. Make your bon-bon cream at least two weeks
before Christmas, and let it have a few days to season before
making it into bon-bons. It will keep for six weeks in cold
weather if necessary and all you have to do is to dampen the
cloth about twice a week, and keep it in a cool, dry place;
if you wish to make bon-bons or wafers at any time, just go
to the crock, take out as much as you need, replace the cloth,
and it is ready for the next time.</p>

<p>If you have a fair sized slab, you can make at least a
five-pound batch of fondant at one time, but if you use a
platter to cool it on, we would not advise you to make more
than about two pounds at a time, as it will not cool quick
enough, and is then liable to grain.</p>

<p>If you ever have a batch of fondant so grainy that you cannot
use it, simply cream it up and use it for fudge or caramels
in place of sugar as the recipe calls.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE
NECESSARY TOOLS.</h2>


<p>The number of tools absolutely necessary for making
candy at home, are very few outside of your ordinary cooking
utensils. But we will mention a few of them here, so that
you may know just what to get in case you care to purchase
them.</p>

<p><b>The Thermometer</b>—You already have, (see article on
“How to Use the Thermometer.”)</p>

<p><b>Marble Slab</b>—The next most important thing both for
its usefulness and convenience is a marble slab. While it is
not absolutely necessary to have one, we would advise everyone
to make an effort to get one. Almost any size or kind
of a piece of marble will do. If you have an old marble top
stand, dresser or some other piece of furniture with a marble
top, use that. If you purchase one, see that it has a nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
smooth top, and the size about 18 x 18 inches. It does not
matter if it is a little larger one way, but this is the standard
size. You can buy candy slabs most any size of any marble
dealer very cheap. If you have a large stone platter, you can
use that for nearly every kind of candy in this book; but buy
a slab by all means if you can.</p>

<p><b>Steel Bars for Slab</b>—Get four steel bars ¾ x ½ inch in
thickness, (they will cost you about thirty cents at any hardware
store). Measure your slab before buying the bars in
this way; if the slab is 18 x 18 inches, get two bars each 17
inches long, then get two each 16 inches long; these bars are
shorter than the first ones, so that they may be set in between
the long ones, making as large or small a dish as the individual
batch requires.</p>

<p><b>Scraper</b>—The best thing to use for creaming up the different
kinds of fondants is an ordinary wall paper scraper,
which can be bought for ten cents at any hardware store. A
wooden butter paddle will answer the purpose if you cannot
get a scraper.</p>

<p><b>Candy Paddle</b>—A wooden paddle is better to use in stirring
candy than a spoon, especially those candies that contain
milk or cream, as they must be stirred continually while cooking
to prevent scorching, and you are very liable to get burned.
Take a piece of wood about 15 inches long and about 2½
inches wide on the paddle end, and about ½ inch thick and
taper it towards the other end for a handle. Keep this paddle
exclusively for stirring candy.</p>

<p><b>Spatula</b>—A spatula is a very convenient tool for the kitchen
and is really as useful for cooking as candy-making. It
may be used for scraping out the candy kettle, cake bowl, removing
pies or cookies from the pan, icing cakes and in various
other ways. A spatula nine inches long will cost you
about 25c at any hardware store.</p>

<p><b>Kettle</b>—Take a granite kettle holding about 2½ gallons,
and it will hold any size batch given in this book. Some candies
boil up considerably and it is necessary to have a large
kettle to avoid its running over. If you make only a pound
or so of candy at a time, take a smaller kettle, so the syrup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
will not scorch and that the bulb of our thermometer will be
well down in the boiling syrup. If possible get a round bottom
kettle, which is better than a flat one, because there are
no edges for the syrup to stick to, and it is much easier to stir,
especially those that must be stirred while cooking.</p>

<img src="images/i-011a.jpg" width="192" height="171" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Funnel</div>
</div>

<p><b>Funnel</b>—If you make wafers frequently, you will find
that a funnel will be a great help to you in dropping them, so
that they will be uniform. Have a tinner make you one after
these directions: Shape a piece of tin 8 inches long like a
cornucopia, 6 inches at the top and tapering to the opening
at the bottom, which should be ⅜ of an inch in diameter; the
handle should be about 5 inches long and shaped like a dipper
handle. A round stick, a flag stick, tapered to fit the opening
is used in dropping the wafers. This funnel is also used for
dropping the cream centers for chocolate. (See article on
“How to Mold in Cornstarch.”)</p>

<img src="images/i-011b.jpg" width="128" height="164" alt="drawing of  hook with two poking through the top sideways" />
<div class="caption">Candy Hook</div>
</div>

<p><b>Candy Hook</b>—In making all kinds of taffy, a hook is the
best thing to pull it on, for taffy which is pulled in this manner,
will be lighter and more fluffy than if pulled with the
hands alone. Any blacksmith can make you one very cheap
in this manner: Take a piece of tinned iron 17 inches long,
and ½ or ¾ inch in diameter; commence a little over half
way down and bend it up like a fish hook. Have the other end
flattened out a little and have two holes bored about two
inches apart so you can screw it on the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Gloves</b>—A pair of canvas gloves with a buckskin face,
slightly greased is a great protection to the hands when pulling
taffy or spreading out the different kinds of brittles. If
they stick to your taffy, just dust them with a little cornstarch
or flour.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i-012a.jpg" width="321" height="171" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Double Boiler</div>
</div>

<p><b>Double Boiler</b>—It is not absolutely necessary to have a
double boiler, but it is a great convenience to have one holding
about a pint or a little more, in which to melt the fondant
or chocolate. You may substitute an ordinary bowl and a
pan of hot water in which to set it, and obtain the same
results.</p>

<p><b>Dipping Wire</b>—This is used in dipping bon-bons and accompanies
the book. (See article on “Bon-Bons.”)</p>

<p><b>Plaster of Paris Moulds</b>—These moulds accompany the
book and are used for making the centers for chocolates. (See
article on “How to Mold in Cornstarch.”)</p>


<h3>HOW TO USE THE THERMOMETER.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 66px;">
<img src="images/i-012b.jpg" width="66" height="326" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Thermometer</div>
</div>

<p>The first thing necessary for you to do is to test your
thermometer. They are supposed to register exactly 212<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
degrees in boiling water, as this is the standard they are made
by; but in <b>different altitudes, water boils at different degrees</b>,
so they are very liable to vary somewhat. The different degrees
given in this book, to which it is necessary to cook the
candies to, are based on the supposition that your thermometer
registers <b>exactly 212 in boiling water</b>; so that if it registers
either <b>higher or lower</b> than that, you must allow for the
<b>difference</b>.</p>

<p>Learn to read it accurately the first thing you do. Put
some water in a kettle on the fire, and as soon it comes to a
boil, set your thermometer down in it with the bottom of the
thermometer as near the center of the pan as possible, and
let it lean over against the side. Let it remain there for a
few moments and then look and see what it registers, and if
it is exactly 212, always cook every recipe in this book to just
the degree called for. It does not matter how long you let
it remain in the boiling water, it will never go any higher after
it comes to a good boil. The reason is this, that the water
will evaporate if you allow it to boil long enough, and consequently
it can never get any hotter. In candy there are other
substances which, as the water evaporates, keep getting hotter
and retain the heat, and for that reason the mercury in the
thermometer will naturally rise higher than 212.</p>

<p>If your thermometer registers lower than 212 degrees in
boiling water, notice very carefully just how many degrees
it is off, and simply deduct that many degrees from the number
given, to which each recipe must be cooked.</p>

<p>If it registers higher than 212, add the number of degrees
it registers over 212, to the amount given for each recipe. For
example: Supposing your thermometer should register <b>209 in
boiling water</b>. It would consequently be <b>three degrees too
low</b>, and in cooking your candy, simply <b>deduct three degrees</b>
from the number called for in the recipe. That is, if you are
making fondant, which called for 240 degrees, only cook to
237, and it will be exactly the same as it would be, if you
cooked it to 240 with a thermometer registering 212 in boiling
water. In case your thermometer registers over 212, simply
add the difference in the same manner as we have directed
you to deduct, in case it was too low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>To avoid mistakes and spoiled candy, we would advise
you to <b>mark each recipe as soon as you have tested your
thermometer</b>.</p>

<p>In using it in candy, put it in the kettle just the same as
directed for testing in boiling water, and it is always necessary
to have enough candy in your kettle to come up over the
bulb, or it will not register accurately. We mean by this, that
if you cook only a small amount of candy, you must put it
in a small kettle, so it will be deep enough to cover the bulb
of the thermometer.</p>

<p>If the candy should cook up on the thermometer so it
would cover the degree to which you intend it, just raise the
thermometer a little, being very careful not to lift the bulb
out of the syrup, wet your finger, pass it over the glass tube,
and you will have no trouble in reading it.</p>

<p>In cooking fudge and such candies in which you use milk
or cream, they will always boil up high on your thermometer
at first, but by the time it is cooked enough to register the
right degree, you will find it has boiled down enough, so the
degree mark will be above the syrup, but you must wet your
finger and wipe off the glass before you can read it.</p>

<p>When cooking candies that require stirring, occasionally
slide the thermometer around the kettle and stir where it
stood, to prevent scorching, being very careful not to lift the
bulb out of the syrup.</p>

<p>While the thermometer is tested, and is subject to sudden
changes of heat, it is always advisable to warm it slightly
before putting it into the boiling syrup. The thermometer is
too expensive to take any risks. There is no danger of its
breaking when put into the boiling syrup, for that is the use
for which it is intended.</p>

<p>Always remember when making candy, that as soon as
the thermometer registers the right degree, lift it out of the
syrup very quickly, and set it in a pan of water and get your
batch off the fire as soon as possible. You must move quickly,
or the candy is liable to go up one or two degrees and that is
sufficient to spoil your batch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Never put it in cold water after taking it out of the batch,
but have a pan of warm water ready so you can set it in as
soon as your batch is done. This will keep your stove from
getting smeared and also protect your thermometer. The
thermometer will never make a mistake if <b>you read it correctly</b>.</p>

<p>Few people are aware that <b>professional candy-makers
use a thermometer</b>, and are under the impression, that all candies
are tested in cold water, better known as the hand test.
Until a few years ago, the candy thermometer was almost unknown
and candy makers everywhere used the hand test; but
when the thermometer was introduced for candy-making, they
were quick to see the possibilities of such an invention and
abandoned the water test, because by cooking with a thermometer,
the candy was always the same, no batches too hard
or too soft, as was the case with the old way.</p>

<p>We will give you the different hand test degrees as compared
with the degrees on a thermometer:</p>

<h2>MATERIAL USED FOR CANDY MAKING</h2>


<p><b>Sugar.</b> In all the recipes that call for sugar, use granulated
sugar unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>When cooking a small amount of sugar a small pan
should be used or else the pan should be placed on an additional
ring, so that the fire will only strike a part of the bottom
of the pan. The heat should never strike the pan above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sugar, this causing it to bake on the sides of the pan and sometimes
dissolving the pan.</p>

<p>Slowly cooked sugar makes tough and sticky candy, so
that candy of any description should be cooked as rapidly as
possible.</p>

<p><b>Confectioner’s Sugar</b>, sometimes called XXXX, is especially
ground for candy making purposes. XXX sugar is a
coarser grade and is not as satisfactory as the XXXX sugar.
Pulverized sugar cannot be used as a substitute and give satisfactory
results, because it hardens.</p>

<p><b>Water.</b> Always use cold water when making candy. The
quantity of water used must be regulated according to the
sugar.</p>

<p><b>Milk.</b> Use fresh milk in preference to Pasteurized or
sterilized milk, because it is not so liable to curdle.</p>

<p><b>Glucose</b> is a very thick, transparent, tasteless liquid extracted
from corn; it is usually of a yellow tinge. Very few
people know how glucose is made and are under the impression
that it is an injurious adulteration. Because glucose is
used extensively in cheap candy, there is a certain amount of
prejudice against it. By using glucose sparingly in certain
candies it imparts a smoothness and also prevents any stirred
candy from turning to sugar.</p>

<p>It may be purchased from any confectioner that makes
his own candy. When purchasing it, it is necessary to take
a bucket or jar, because it must be put into something that
will be easy to get it out on account of its sticky quality.</p>

<p>In putting it into the kettle, first weigh the kettle with
the paddle, take out the glucose with the paddle and when you
think you have the required amount, weigh the glucose, kettle
and paddle. If you do not have scales to weigh it, be <b>very
careful</b> not to use too much glucose, because it will spoil some
candies.</p>

<p>Glucose is easily handled in cold weather, because it gets
very thick. Dip your hand in cold water, scoop out a small
quantity of glucose, keeping your hand moving all the time;
by doing this it will not stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>One pint of glucose weighs one and a half pounds.</p>

<p><b>Corn Syrup</b>, which is ninety per cent. glucose, may be
purchased at almost any grocery and may be used as a substitute
for glucose. Use a little more than the amount of glucose
called for. Corn syrup is of a yellow color, consequently all
of the candies in which it is used will be of a cream color.
(See cream of tartar.)</p>

<p><b>Acetic Acid.</b> The addition of acid in candy, “breaks the
grain” of the sugar, and brings out the flavor.</p>

<p>It may be purchased at a drug store. Ask for No. 8 and
five cents worth will last a long time because it is only used
for making fondant and oriental creams.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Tartar.</b> (Substitute for glucose.) As a rule a
fourth of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar is used for every
five pounds of sugar in making various kinds of candies, such
as butterscotch, brittle, center cream; it may also be used for
making a grainy fudge, which is the only exception when it
is used in a stirred candy.</p>

<p><b>Japanese Gelatine</b>, a vegetable gelatine, is used in making
the various jellies. The ordinary gelatine cannot be used as
a substitute.</p>

<p><b>Nonparaf</b> must be used instead of paraffine in all candy
made for sale, on account of the pure food laws. It is used in
chewing taffy and caramels; it keeps them in shape and preserves
their good qualities. It may be omitted, but by so
doing a certain chewing quality of the candy is destroyed.</p>

<p><b>Chocolate.</b> Only coating chocolate should be used for
candy making because it is stronger in flavor and imparts a
delicate taste such as no other kind does. It may be bought
of any confectioner, who makes his own candy, in ten pound
cakes.</p>

<p><b>Flavors.</b> The best candies may be spoiled by using cheap
flavorings, and we strongly advise you to buy the very best.
Only a few drops are required for flavoring candies and, by
buying a few at a time you will be able to have a large assortment
in a short while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Color Pastes</b> may be used for coloring ice cream, cakes,
icings and desserts and they add a dainty touch to an otherwise
ordinary dish. Those that are used for candy making
are adapted for all other needs, are pure and strong, so that
a two ounce jar will last a long time. Colors seem to be a
necessity when making bon-bons, and we offer you a variety.
Leaf green, fruit red, golden yellow, damask rose, caramel,
violet, chestnut, mandarin orange and imperial blue.</p>

<p>Color pastes which we sell are made from vegetable colorings
and are guaranteed under the pure food laws.</p>

<p><b>Almond Paste</b> is used as centers for bon-bons.</p>

<p><b>Paper.</b> Waxed or oiled paper. You may use the ordinary
waxed paper that is found in all stores for covering butter,
etc. Waxed paper is used to line candy boxes and also
for wrapping candies.</p>

<p><b>Wafer Paper.</b> For dropping purposes, a heavier paper is
required, such as is found in cracker boxes, cookies, etc. Save
all these papers, iron them flat and they will answer the purpose
and save you the expense of buying wafer paper.</p>

<p><b>Rice Paper</b> is only used when making nougat, and can be
bought at a confectioner’s.</p>

<p>Wax paper bags are a neat and sanitary way of putting
up salted and fresh nuts.</p>

<h2>HOW TO CRACK NUTS AND PREPARE TOPS
FOR BON-BONS.</h2>


<p>It is more convenient to buy your nuts already shelled,
although it is more expensive. English walnuts are probably
used more than any other nut, for tops of bon-bons and centers
also. It is probably better to purchase these with shells
on and crack them yourself, as they are very easily cracked.</p>

<p>In purchasing these nuts, get the smallest ones possible,
as the smaller they are the prettier they will look on your
candies. We advise you to always keep your bon-bons small
in size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The California English walnuts do not crack out as pretty
as the Grenoble nut does, as the meat in them is a much prettier
shape and rougher on top, and looks much nicer on the
bons-bons. The Grenoble nut is an English walnut, imported
from Germany, and you may always distinguish them from
the fact that you can stand them on end; while a California
English walnut is so pointed at the ends that it will not
stand up. Crack carefully on the side which does not have
the ridge running down it, as then the halves will come out
perfectly whole. The ones that break may be chopped up
and saved, to be used in the centers of the bon-bons.</p>

<p>Almonds are very easily cracked and you will have no
trouble with them. Always crack hickory nuts on the edge.
Black walnuts should be cracked on the broad side, as you
never use them only in small pieces, and it is not necessary to
use any care in cracking them. In some candies, these walnuts
are finer than any other nut, as they give the candy a
peculiar flavor, especially in caramels and different taffies.
These are the ordinary walnuts that grow wild all over the
country.</p>

<p>Pecans are a very hard nut to get out whole, but if you
purchase as large thin-shelled ones as possible, put them in a
pan, pour cold water over them, let them stand for about five
hours, then pour off the water and let stand for a while, or
even over night until they dry off on the outside, you will then
be able to get the meats out very nicely without them breaking
much. They are a very brittle nut, but by soaking them as directed,
they do not break very easily. Crack on the side which
does not have the small vein running from end to end, taking
care not to hit them too hard, and you will find that the halves
will split open very nicely; and if you will use a little care in
removing them from the shell, by using a knife with which to
loosen them around the edge, you will be able to get a great
many of the halves out perfect.</p>

<p>Use the perfect halves for the tops of your bon-bons. Pick
over the broken ones and save the largest pieces of them with
which to make Chocolate Pecan Fritters (see recipe), and the
small pieces you may chop up fine and use for centers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
takes about two pounds of unshelled pecans, almonds, or English
walnuts, to make one pound of shelled meats.</p>

<p>For peanut candy, always get if possible, the small unroasted
Spanish peanut, and they may be purchased of any
confectioner or candy factory, and at a great many of the large
stores. They come already shelled and should cost you from
twelve and one half to fifteen cents a pound. These nuts are
much finer in flavor than the large peanut, and by using the
raw ones and roasting them in the candy as we direct you in
the recipe, you will find the flavor of your candy much nicer.
Of course, if you wish to use peanuts for the centers of bon-bons
or chocolate creams, any kind of roasted ones chopped
up will answer the purpose.</p>

<p>In chopping your nuts, it is much better to lay them on
the table and use a butcher knife with which to cut them up,
than it is to put them in a bowl and use a chopping knife; as
by chopping them in a bowl, you are unable to get them so
uniform, as the ones at the bottom will be chopped up into a
fine powder, for which you have no use, before the ones on top
are small enough. By cutting them up with a knife as directed,
you will be able to get them all about the same size. You
will see the advantage of this after trying it once.</p>

<p>Pistachio nuts make one of the prettiest tops you can
find for bon-bons. They are a small, dark green nut, which
may be purchased at a great many large grocery stores in
cities, if you live convenient to one. Also some confectioners
have them on hand, but not many of them. They are an expensive
nut, but a few of them go a great ways, as they must
be split in two. After splitting them open, save the prettiest
halves for the tops of the bon-bons, and all broken and off-colored
ones you may chop up very fine, and use for sprinkling
over the tops of your pink bon-bons and they also look
very pretty sprinkled over chocolate creams before the chocolate
hardens.</p>

<h2>BON-BON CREAM (FONDANT).</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 655px;">
<img src="images/i-021.jpg" width="655" height="326" alt="candy making supplies photo" />
</div>

<p>Have all of these articles conveniently at hand: Place
the table in a position where the air will strike it on all sides
from a door or window. Be sure that it is level and that you
can pass around it. Arrange the kettle in the most convenient
manner, so that when you lift it off the stove you will not
have to turn it about or jar it unnecessarily, as this is sufficient
to spoil the syrup.</p>


<h3>BON-BON CREAM.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 pounds Granulated Sugar.</li>
<li>6 drops Acetic Acid.</li>
<li>1½ pints cold Water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar and water into the kettle and place it over
a HOT FIRE (it must boil quickly and not be allowed to
simmer), and stir constantly until it commences to boil. It
is not necessary to stir quickly, but the sugar must not be
allowed to settle. USE THE WOODEN PADDLE or spoon
to stir with, and splash the syrup against the sides of the kettle
to wash down the granulations. Just before the syrup
begins to boil, wipe down the sides of the kettle with a damp
cloth and BE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO GRANULATIONS
ON THE SIDES OF THE KETTLE, because, unless
they are removed they would make the fondant gritty.
NEVER STIR THE SYRUP AFTER IT BEGINS TO
BOIL. NEVER JAR OR MOVE THE KETTLE WHILE
THE SYRUP IS COOKING.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>When the syrup begins to boil, add the acetic acid. Drop
it on a spoon because you might not drop it accurately. TOO
MUCH ACID would spoil the candy. Put the lid on the kettle
and let it steam for several minutes. This is done so that
the steam will wash down the sides of the kettle and remove
some remaining grains of sugar that might be sticking to the
sides. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF
THESE GRAINS SHOULD BE REMOVED. Do not remove
the lid until the steam is coming out freely around the
edges, because it does not matter if the lid is left on a little
longer than three minutes. Remove the lid and put in the
thermometer, so that the bulb is covered with the syrup. The
thermometer may be read easier if it is fastened to the kettle
by the hook on the back of the case. If a black scum appears
on the surface do not disturb it until it gathers into a bunch,
then carefully remove it by using a spoon and do not disturb
the syrup.</p>

<p>While the syrup is cooking, prepare the slab by washing
it with a damp cloth. Do not dry it and NEVER GREASE
THE SLAB WHEN MAKING FONDANT. Place the bars
in position. If you use a platter instead of a slab, it must be
ice cold.</p>

<p>When the thermometer registers <b>240</b> (remember to make
the correct allowance if your thermometer does not register
<b>212</b> in boiling water), remove it quickly. See that your way
is clear, lift the kettle off the stove and carry it to the slab,
taking great care not to shake the syrup. Pour the syrup
on the slab, beginning in the center at one end of the slab,
pouring down toward the corner and while doing this, keep
the kettle as close to the slab as you can, and at the end,
quickly tip up the kettle so that it will not drip. NEVER
ALLOW THE LAST OF THE SYRUP TO DRIP OUT
OVER WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY POURED ON
THE SLAB. NEVER SCRAPE OUT THE KETTLE, because
these drops and scrapings will granulate, and when the
syrup is cold there will be sugared spots on top. If this should
occur, they must be removed before the syrup is worked, because
they would make the fondant gritty. NEVER MOVE
THE TABLE OR PLATTER WHILE THE SYRUP IS<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
COOLING AS THIS WOULD RUIN THE CANDY. Allow
the syrup to remain on the slab until cold. Test it by using
the back of the hand, as it is more sensitive than the palm.
WHEN THE SYRUP IS COLD IT IS READY TO BE
WORKED. Then it should be as smooth as glass.</p>


<h3>WORKING THE FONDANT.</h3>

<p>Remove the bars by running a corner of the scraper between
them and the syrup.</p>

<p>With the scraper or wooden paddle commence by scooping
or turning the syrup toward the center so as to get it into
a mass in the center of the slab, as shown in <a href="#Fig_1-1">Fig. 1</a>. Continue
turning it over and over; always work from the edge and keep
the scraper in the position of <a href="#Fig_1-1">Fig. 1</a>. The mass will move
from one end of the slab to the other, but by always working
around the edge, you will be able to keep the syrup in a mass
and prevent it from spreading over the slab. Each time that
you turn up the syrup, scrape the slab clean and turn the
scraper up and over the mass as shown in <a href="#Fig_2-1">Fig. 2</a>. This movement
removes the syrup from the scraper and when it works
up to the handle, clean the scraper with a knife. Sugar will
soon appear on the under side of the scraper, but this is only
an indication that the syrup is reaching the creamy stage, when
it will become much thinner and easier to work; also it will
require more rapid working to prevent it from running off
the slab. (<a href="#Fig_3-1">Fig. 3</a>.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 3</div>
</div>

<p>When this stage is reached, work rapidly and in a short
time it will become harder and finally become a hard ball when
it is finished (<a href="#Fig_4-1">Fig. 4</a>). Scrape off any remaining particles on
the slab; clean the scraper, and put this sugar on the batch.
Wring out a heavy cotton cloth out of COLD WATER (such
as a piece of toweling), so that it is damp, and place this cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
over the fondant on the slab; tuck it in on all sides, allowing
it to remain for a half hour. This sweats or seasons it and
mellows the fondant. Remove the cloth and your efforts will
be rewarded by a mass of snow-white fondant, smooth as velvet.
Cut it into chunks and put them into a crock or stone
jar. Wet the cloth, (wring it out well), and lay it over the
top of the crock. It must not touch the fondant, because the
cloth will draw the syrup and absorb the moisture of the fondant.
In three days it will be ready for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;"><a id="Fig_4-1"></a>
<img src="images/i-025.jpg" width="494" height="410" alt="photograph from here on--lump of fondant" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4</div>
</div>

<p>The fondant may be kept six months in a dry, cool place.
Keep the cloth moist. You may have the delicious bon-bons
at any time, as the fondant is always ready for immediate use.</p>

<p>If, after you have poured the syrup on the slab, you find
that some scum has poured out with it, remove it just before
you begin to work the syrup, because it will then be cold and
there will be no danger of spoiling it.</p>

<p>If, when you begin to work the syrup and you find there
are granulations on the bottom of the slab, or through the
syrup, it indicates that you disturbed the syrup while cooking,
jarred it too much when pouring it out, cooked it too high or
did not cool it rapidly. If this should occur, work the syrup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
according to the above instructions and the sugar may be
used for cooking purposes or for any kind of candy EXCEPT
FONDANT.</p>

<p>You never beat the fondant, but it may be kneaded before
putting it into the crock, if you wish to make it finer grained.</p>

<p>When the fondant is kept for any length of time, a crust
forms on top, if the cloth becomes dry, which may be melted
with the rest of the fondant. It is not spoiled. The contact
of the air is the cause of this crust forming. Moisten the
cloth and the crust will soften in a short while.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Never begin to work the syrup until it
is cold. This is one of the secrets of perfect bon-bon cream.</p>

<p>Before you pour the syrup on the slab, wet your hand a
little in cold water and moisten the slab, but do not get it too
wet.</p>

<p>If any of the syrup should run out, hold something at
the place where it is running out underneath the bars (for a
minute or two) until the syrup hardens a little and it will
stop running out. NEVER PUT THE SYRUP THAT HAS
RUN OUT IN THE BATCH ON THE SLAB, BECAUSE
IT WOULD MAKE THE WHOLE BATCH GRAINY.</p>

<p>Always use the same side of the slab for fondant, and
this side must never be greased.</p>

<p>Bon-bon cream should always be covered, so that it does
not dry out.</p>

<p>It should not be used the same day that it is made.</p>

<p>Don’t allow the batch to get too cold, as that takes all the
life out of the sugar.</p>

<p>The crock may be covered with wax paper and a lid.</p>

<p>Do not make a batch larger than what you can cool
quickly on your slab, because it will take too long to cool
properly. Sugar that is cooled slowly loses its strength and
after it is melted, it will not keep a good string, and also will
be dull looking within a few days.</p>

<p>If the fondant in the crock becomes hard from neglecting
to keep the cloth damp with which it is covered, wet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cloth, squeeze it slightly and place it over the crock. The
moisture will be taken up by the fondant, which will be as
good as before the moisture was evaporated.</p>

<p>If you should be so unfortunate as to spoil a batch of
fondant, you can use the sugar for most any kind of candy,
except fondant or orientals, by simply using the grained fondant
in place of sugar.</p>


<h3>MAPLE FONDANT.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds Maple Sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound Granulated Sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint Water.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot procure the maple sugar, use the following
recipe:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 pounds Maple Syrup.</li>
<li>1 pound Granulated Sugar.</li>
<li>½ pint Water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maple fondant is made in the same manner as bon-bon
cream. There is no acid used with the maple fondant.</p>

<p>It is more sticky than the white fondant, but is delicious.</p>


<h3>COFFEE FONDANT.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound Sugar.</li>
<li>2 drops Acetic Acid.</li>
<li>1 cup strong Coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow the directions given for bon-bon cream.</p>


<h3>FILLINGS FOR BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>You may use fillings of any kind you are particularly
fond of, but we will mention a few, so as to give you an idea of
the different kinds, and will tell you how to use them later on.
One of the finest fillings is composed of candied cherries and
candied citron ground up together, or chopped very fine. If
you should have a food grinder in the house, use that for this
purpose; but if you have none, a chopping knife and bowl will
answer the purpose. About two parts cherries and one part
citron makes a fine combination, but you may use any proportion
you wish. A small amount of candied orange peel ground
with them, gives a peculiar flavor, which is liked by many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Any kind of candied fruit, such as pears, plums, limes, or pineapple,
ground very fine, make a nice filling. Figs, after removing
the hard part around the stem, then ground up alone
or with a little orange peel added to them, make a very fine filling.
In fact, most any fruit of this order, such as raisins or
dates, will do, but they are not so nice as the French candied
fruits. It is best to prepare quite an amount of these different
fillings while you are at it, as they will keep indefinitely without
drying out, if put in a small jar of some kind with a tight
cover on it. By doing this you will save a great deal of time
and trouble, as your fillings are always prepared for you, and
any time you wish to make a few bon-bons it will not be necessary
to stop and grind your fillings.</p>

<p>Almond paste, which may be purchased at any bakery
where they make macaroons, makes a very fine filling. It is all
prepared when you buy it, and is to be worked in with the bon-bon
cream the same as the chopped fruit. It is not expensive,
and will also keep for a long time in a closed jar.</p>

<p>Ground pecans, English walnuts, hickory nuts, and Brazil
nuts (sometimes called nigger toes), are about the best nuts
to use for centers. It is also best to grind as many of these at
a time as possible, as they will not spoil in cold weather. Fresh
grated cocoanut may also be used, by working it in your bon-bon
cream, for centers of cocoanut bon-bons; but we will tell
you a much nicer way to make a cocoanut filling later on. Any
bon-bon with the ground fruit center in it will keep fresh much
longer than one in which you use only nuts. You will find that,
if you put enough ground fruit in the centers, after your bon-bons
are a week or ten days old, they are very soft and sticky
inside, which is caused by the fruit sweating, and are delicious.
Some people will wonder how you were ever able to get a center
so soft.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE BON-BONS.</h2>


<p>As nearly all bon-bons are made in the same manner, we
will explain very carefully how to make one or two kinds, and
after you understand the idea, you may make any shape, color,
or flavor you desire. We will now tell you how to make pink,
rose flavor bon-bons, in several shapes. Take a small amount
of bon-bon cream, and from one third to one half as much
ground cherries and citron (see article on Bon-Bon Fillings)
as you have bon-bon cream, and with your hands work and
knead them well together. This center, especially, is very
sticky, and you will be obliged to work enough XXXX or confectioners’
sugar into it to make it stiff enough so that you can
mould it up into different shapes easily. Right here we will
say that in getting the XXXX sugar, do not allow them to give
you XXX sugar, as it is a little gritty, while XXXX sugar is
as smooth as flour. Of course, if you cannot obtain XXXX
sugar the other will do, but is not so nice.</p>

<p>After you commence kneading this bon-bon cream and
fruit, add a little sugar at a time, knead it in well and as
soon as you get the mass so it feels a little dry, it is ready
to mould up. You must use a little judgment in doing this, as
you only need work sufficient sugar into it to make it stiff
enough so that the centers will retain their shape after being
moulded. If you wish any flavoring, put a few drops into it
while you are working in the sugar. In centers where you use
only chopped nuts, and no fruit of any kind, it is not necessary
to use much, if any sugar at all, as the nuts have a tendency to
make the cream work up dry. Sometimes bon-bon cream is
stickier than it is at other times, so if necessary use the sugar,
but never use any other than XXXX or confectioners’ sugar.</p>

<p>When worked sufficiently, cut off a piece and roll it with
your hands into a long roll about as large around as a cigar;
then cut in small pieces about one half inch long and roll each
of them in your hands until they are perfectly round, then lay
them on a piece of wax paper, and when they are all moulded,
set them in a cool place for a while until they harden a
little. We advise rolling out in this manner before cutting up
to roll into balls, as it will enable you to get them all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the same size. If you find upon starting to roll them into balls
that it is still too sticky, you must knead in a little more sugar.</p>

<p>Do not get the centers too large, as your bon-bons are
much prettier when small. Bear this in mind in all bon-bon
making, as most amateurs have a tendency to make their bon-bons
and chocolates too large, and the more dainty your candy
looks, both as to size and color, the better it tastes. After
making part of them round, take the remainder of the mass
and pat it out into a flat piece about one-half inch thick and
cut it up in strips seven-eighths inch wide; then take each
strip and cut it into pieces about one-half inch wide and here
you have oblong centers seven-eighths by one-half inch, which
are for the centers of bon-bons, on top of which you put a nut.
Remember, after these centers are coated they will be quite
a little larger than this, and you must try and keep them small
enough so that after they are coated, the half of an English
walnut will almost completely cover the top of them. Of course
if you use a smaller nut for the top, your bon-bons will necessarily
be larger than the nut, and still they will not be large
enough to look bad. The ones upon the top of which you use
the half of a pistachio nut, must necessarily be considerably
larger than the nut. We give you these little details, as they
improve the looks of your candy so much, and you will be able
to make them to look pretty the first time, and not be obliged
to experiment any in order to get the correct size. If you wish
to use a pistachio nut on these, they are prettier if you cut
these centers <b>square</b>, instead of oblong, making them about
five-eighths or three-fourths inch each way.</p>

<p>Experience alone will teach you as to how much bon-bon
cream it will be necessary to melt up in order to cover the
centers you have moulded. Put your bon-bon cream in the
double boiler with boiling water under it, keep it on the fire and
stir continually, that is, do not let it stand over a few minutes
at a time without stirring, and when it is melted, flavor with a
few drops of rose flavoring and color a delicate pink with Damask
Rose coloring (Burnett’s), by adding a little at a time
until you have the desired shade. It will probably be necessary
to add a few drops of cold water to your fondant while
melting in order to make it thin enough. Add the water very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<b>sparingly</b>, as it does not require much to thin it, and if you
get too much in, your bon-bons will not harden for you after
being coated, and neither will they, if the cream is not hot before
dipping. Test it the same as you do center cream, by
sticking your tongue to it, and you should not allow it to get
as hot as you do the center cream. Practice alone will tell
you about how thin it should be. You must have it so that
when you dip the bon-bons out and lay them on wax paper,
they will not stick to the dipping fork, but drop off readily, and
as you lift the fork the cream will string out a little so that you
may make any design you wish on the top. After dipping a
a few, you will understand more about this and will have no
trouble. As soon as thin enough, and colored and flavored, set
the double boiler on your table, leaving it in the hot water to
keep it warm. You must avoid sitting in a draught while coating
these, as this cream hardens very quickly. Now pick up a
center, and with the dipping fork in your other hand stir the
cream thoroughly on one side to break the crust which forms
on top, then drop in the center, push it under with the fork,
then stick the fork underneath it so it will rest as near the end of
the fork as possible, lift it up and scrape off most of the surplus
cream hanging to it by drawing it over the edge of kettle,
then quickly turn your fork over and lay the bon-bon on the
wax paper, lift the fork, and with the cream that strings up
with it, make the design on top, by twisting it in the form of
a knot. Do this by moving your fork quickly in a circle. You
will see by this, as you lift the bon-bon out of the cream, the
side, or bottom rather, which you scrape off on the edge of
the kettle, is the top of the bon-bon after you turn your fork
over and lay it on the paper; so do not scrape it off too much,
as it is necessary to leave a little cream hanging there in order
to have some lift up with the fork with which to make the design
on top.</p>

<p>This whole operation, after you set the cream over on the
table to commence dipping, must be done very rapidly, and
you will soon learn to drop these centers in, lift them out, lay
them on the paper, and make designs, with almost <b>one continual
motion</b>, which is very necessary, as the bon-bons harden in
a few seconds after lifting them out of the cream, and must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
dropped from the fork very quickly or they will stick. You
must stir this cream with a spoon occasionally while dipping,
and it is necessary each time you throw a center in, to break
this crust with the dipping fork first. When your cream commences
to thicken so that they do not drop readily from the
fork, add a few drops of cold water and stir it in well, and continue
the dipping. If you have had it off the stove for quite
a while, it is better to set it back until the water under it boils
again, then add a little cold water, take it off, and continue
the dipping. In dropping these off the fork, press it down so
that your bon-bon will touch the paper, when it will stick a
little, and you can easily lift your fork up. On these pink bon-bons,
a little of the finely chopped pistachio nuts sprinkled over
them, and pressed down slightly so that it will stick, makes
them look very pretty. This must be done immediately after
lifting the fork as they will harden in a few seconds.</p>

<p>In coating the oblong centers, when you lift the fork,
simply allow the cream that comes up with it to drop back on
the bon-bon, then quickly lay on the half of an English walnut
and press it down a very little. These bon-bons do not stick
to this wax paper a particle and are <b>set</b> perfectly in a few moments
after dipping them. They should be perfectly smooth
all over, and very glossy, and will be like this if you have your
bon-bon cream the right consistency when dipping them.</p>

<p>All bon-bons are coated in the same manner, and after you
have tried it once or twice it will be very easy, and you will be
able to dip a great many of them in a few moments, as you
must necessarily work rapidly after your cream is once melted
up. These are the swellest bon-bons made, and putting the
chopped fruit and nuts in the center in this manner, and dipping
them as directed, seals them up perfectly air-tight, and
consequently they will keep for quite a while. You may use
any combination of nuts or fruit that you wish in these centers,
but always put in enough of either in order to have them
taste sufficiently. We will now give a few ideas in regard to
making other colored and flavored bon-bons, but if you have
any ideas of your own you may adopt them.</p>

<p>Many candy makers make fine cream, but spoil it when
melting the same because no matter how good the cream is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
it can be spoiled when a little too much heat is applied. It is
also a great mistake to reheat the cream more than once without
getting it too watery and it will then dry out in a short
time.</p>

<p>There is no dipping cream made that will keep the gloss
for any length of time.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to make bon-bons at night, because it is
difficult to get the colors the right shade. A color may look
dainty at night, but be hideous in day time, especially yellow
and lavender. Colors and flavors should be delicate as the
taste of the candy seems to improve with its appearance.
When adding colors always add a little at a time. More may
be added but none can be taken out.</p>

<p>You will find from experience that it will always be necessary
to melt more fondant than you will need to coat the centers
you have made, because you must have a certain amount
in the double boiler in order to dip them successfully. As you
get to the bottom you will find it thickens very quickly and
you will have to add more water. Do not get into the habit
of adding too much water while dipping the bon-bons as it will
spoil their looks; it is liable to dilute the coating so that it
will not be hard enough.</p>

<p>If you have melted too much it is not wasted. Have
some shelled nuts ready and coat them after you have finished
with the centers, or flavor the remaining cream with either peppermint
or wintergreen, as these flavors will kill any flavor
that you have used. With a spoon, drop it on wax paper in
wafers.</p>

<p>If, after you have centers for chocolate coating and do not
wish to coat all that you have made, they may be dipped in
melted fondant the same as any other center.</p>

<p>If bon-bons become soft when brought into a warm room,
it indicates that too much water was used when dissolving
the fondant, or it was not heated enough.</p>


<h3>LEMON FIG BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Use chopped figs to mix with bon-bon cream for centers,
and cut them oblong shape and coat with bon-bon cream,
flavored with lemon and colored yellow. You will find Burnett’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Golden Yellow Paste makes a beautiful color. It is
better to make this color in the daytime, as it is very difficult
to get the desired shade at night. You must get your coating
a pretty deep shade of yellow or it will not show up well on
the bon-bons. Either an English walnut, or pecan, are very
pretty on this bon-bon, and be sure to put it on just after you
drop it from the fork, in order to have it stick.</p>


<h3>NECTAR BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Make same as others, using chopped pecans with bon-bon
cream for the centers, and flavor slightly with nectar while
kneading it. Roll it into small balls and coat with bon-bon
cream colored pale green, and flavored with nectar.</p>


<h3>VIOLET BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Use any kind of chopped nuts to mix with bon-bon cream
for centers, flavor slightly with violet if you have it, if not you
may use nectar or vanilla. Make them round and coat with
violet colored and flavored bon-bon cream. You will find when
you are using violet colored cream with which to dip them,
that by adding a small amount of the Damask Rose coloring
to the cream after you get it a good violet shade, it will make
them much prettier, as the violet shade will be a little brighter,
more on the lavender order.</p>


<h3>PISTACHIO BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Use almond paste mixed with bon-bon cream for the centers,
and do not use any flavoring, as the almond paste flavors
it. Use about one-third as much paste as you do cream, in
making the centers. It will be necessary to use more XXXX
sugar in these than it is in the ones with nuts in, to enable you
to get them stiff enough to retain their shape after cutting
them in squares. Cut them in small squares as directed in first
bon-bon recipe, and as soon as they dry a little, coat them in
plain white bon-bon cream, flavored slightly with either pistachio
or almond flavor, and put one-half of a pistachio nut or
small piece of angelique on the top. Of course you may use
any kind of nut on these if you have not the ones mentioned,
but the green and white make a very pretty combination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
These bon-bons are very fine and will keep for a long time.
This same center, coated with bon-bon cream which has been
colored a Mandarin Yellow (Burnett’s), makes a very pretty
bon-bon.</p>


<h3>COATED CHERRIES.</h3>

<p>Take as large and as round candied cherries as possible,
and coat them in the same manner as you do the other centers,
using a rose colored and flavored bon-bon cream for the coating
and sprinkle chopped pistachio nuts on top, or leave them
plain if desired. These makes a delicious bon-bon, but will
not keep as long as the others, as the coating becomes hard in
a few days, whereas it does not on the ones with the chopped
fruit or nut centers.</p>


<h3>ORIENTAL JELLY OR FIG PASTE BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Buy some fig paste, or Oriental jelly, as it is similar, at
any candy store, cut it in small pieces, and coat with any desired
color or flavor of bon-bon cream you wish, or you may
leave the pieces large and coat them, and when they are cool
cut them in two with a sharp knife, and they make a very
pretty bon-bon.</p>


<h3>MARSHMALLOW BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Buy some marshmallows, as that is much cheaper and
easier than making them, and coat with bon-bon cream same as
other centers, and unless you are able to buy the very small
marshmallows, it is best to cut them in pieces before coating
them. You may color the coating in any manner you wish.
Blanch a few almonds, split them open, and put a half of one
on the top of each bon-bon as soon as dipped, putting the flat
side of the nut up, or you may leave them perfectly plain if
you prefer to.</p>


<h3>MAPLE BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Mix chopped nuts with either maple or white bon-bon
cream for the centers, cut in oblong pieces, and coat with
maple bon-bon cream, putting either a half of a pecan or
English walnut on top of each. In melting your cream for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the coating, it requires no coloring or flavoring but simply
use it just as it is, and this really makes the finest bon-bon
there is made.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Mix fresh grated cocoanut with bon-bon cream for your
centers, mould in balls, and coat same as others. Flavor and
color coating as you wish, and as a great many prefer these and
other cocoanut bon-bons coated with chocolate colored coating,
you may do that by simply adding enough melted chocolate to
your bon-bon cream after it is melted up to give it the desired
color. These make a very nice bon-bon, but I will tell you
later on how to make a cocoanut center which is far ahead of
these, but a little more trouble.</p>


<h3>NUT BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Take either English walnuts, pecans, or Brazil nuts, and
coat them with bon-bon cream same as you do the other centers.
You may use any flavor or color coating desired, but I
think that the lemon flavored coating tastes the best on these
nuts. Of course, if you use maple cream with which to coat
nuts, they are much nicer.</p>

<p>Dates, with the seeds removed and then rolled up together,
coated in the same manner, are very nice, and if you take a
sharp knife and cut them in two diagonally after coating them,
they look very pretty.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CREAM WAFERS.</h2>


<p>All kinds of cream wafers, such as peppermint, wintergreen,
chocolate, and also maple, are made from bon-bon
cream. Take the desired amount of fondant and put it in the
double boiler, set it on the fire, keep stirring it, and when it
has melted, flavor and color as you wish.</p>

<p>If you make peppermint wafers, leave it just a plain
white. In wintergreen wafers, add a small amount of damask
rose coloring, to make them a delicate pink.</p>

<p>If your cream is not thin enough to drop off the spoon
readily, you may add a few drops of water, then drop out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
wax paper in small patties about as large as a half dollar. In
dropping them out, if you have no funnel, you may use the
spoon with which you stirred the cream, and try to take just
enough each time on the spoon to make one wafer, but in
case you dip out too much, when the wafer is the desired size,
quickly turn your spoon up, in order to stop its running, and
continue dropping them until your cream is too stiff to drop,
when you may add a few more drops of water, stir in well
and continue as before.</p>

<p>If you use a funnel, heat it with hot water; push the stick
down into the funnel until it fits the opening tightly, because
the stick keeps the melted fondant from running through.
Pour the heated cream into the funnel; hold the funnel over
the wax paper and with one hand raise the stick a trifle; let
enough cream run out to form a wafer; push the stick into
the opening immediately and continue to drop the wafers in
the same manner. You must work rapidly, for the cream gets
chilled in a few seconds.</p>

<p>These wafers are very easily made as you see, and by
always having your bon-bon cream made up as we directed
you, it is only a few minutes work to make up quite a number
of these wafers.</p>

<p>In making chocolate wafers, simply add enough finely
chopped chocolate to give them a good color, and finish same
as the others.</p>

<p>Always lay the wax paper on wood, to prevent white
spots in the wafers.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>COCOANUT CENTERS.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. sugar.</li>
<li>½ lb. glucose.</li>
<li>¾ lb. shredded cocoanut.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla extract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose, and water in the kettle, set on the fire,
stir until it boils, wash down the sides of the kettle with a
damp cloth, put in the thermometer and cook to 238, then set
off stove and stir in the cocoanut, and a small lump of butter
about the size of a hickory nut, and the vanilla flavoring. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
by pressing your hand down on the batch it does not stick
much, it is about right, but if it should stick, simply work in
a little more cocoanut. The idea is, that it is necessary to
have this to the consistency where it may be moulded into
balls; and of course if it is not thick enough, add cocoanut
until it is. The amount of glucose you use in this prevents it
from sugaring. As soon as you have mixed it thoroughly,
scrape it out of the kettle and spread on slab or platter until
it gets cold; then mould it into balls, lay them on wax paper,
and allow to stand for a while until they dry off a little, then
coat with either bon-bon cream the same as other bon-bons,
or with pure chocolate the same as other chocolate dipping is
done. If you do not get these centers too stiff, they sweat a
great deal after being coated, and become very soft and sticky
inside, and for anyone liking cocoanut, they make a fine piece
of candy.</p>

<p>This center is not liable to turn to sugar for you, but if
it should happen to grain a little, you will know that you have
stirred it too much, when adding the cocoanut.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>COCOANUT KISSES.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ lb. sugar.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
<li>1 fresh grated cocoanut.</li>
<li>½ lb. bon-bon cream.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar and water on the fire, stir until it commences
boiling, but just before it boils, wash down the sides
of the kettle with a damp cloth and cold water, then add the
grated cocoanut, and continue stirring until it has boiled a
little while, when you test it by lifting the paddle out, and if
by taking a little of the candy between your thumb and forefinger
it is good and sticky, and strings out when you pull
your fingers apart, it has cooked enough. This is about the
only method of testing it, and you need have no fear of spoiling
it, as it is a very easy candy to make as you will see.</p>

<p>When it is cooked to the right consistency, set off the
fire and add the bon-bon cream, and stir this through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
batch thoroughly until it is dissolved, and the batch becomes
creamy looking and commences to stiffen up. In case it does
not get stiff enough to dip out as directed later on, it is because
it was not cooked quite enough, and you may overcome
this by simply adding a little more bon-bon cream. Add the
vanilla extract when creaming it. Now take an ordinary table
fork, and commence at the edge and take up a small quantity
of the candy on the fork, and lay it on wax paper, and as you
lift the fork up from it, the same as bon-bons, the cocoanut
will string up to some extent and make them rough looking,
which improves their looks. As to the amount to take out on
the fork each time, will say that you should take enough to
make the kisses about the size of your thumb, as they will be
oblong in shape, when dipping them out with an ordinary
fork in this manner. They should retain their shape when
dropped on the wax paper, but if they do not do so, simply
work in a little more bon-bon cream. Always dip it from
around the edge, as it gets harder there first. After dropping
out about one-third of the batch in this manner, color the
remainder a pink, and flavor with strawberry, but work it in
well with the paddle, and in case the batch is a little too thick
by this time, you may add a very little cold water to thin it.
Now dip them out the same as before, until you have about
half of it remaining, then into this remainder pour some
melted chocolate, which you must have ready, add a little
more vanilla, work it in well, and dip out the same as before.
You now see you have three different colored and flavored
kisses from the same batch, and these different flavors do not
interfere with each other by putting them in as directed, as
the strawberry kills the vanilla, and in the last instance the
chocolate kills the strawberry. You may, if you prefer, make
the whole batch one flavor, but you have more of a variety if
you make them in this manner. You may use the ordinary
desiccated cocoanut, which comes put up in packages if you
wish, but if you use fresh grated cocoanut, you will find they
are much nicer and will keep longer. While it is not necessary,
it improves them greatly, by adding the well beaten
whites of two eggs to the batch when you put in the bon-bon
cream, and working it in at the same time. This has a tendency
to make them a little lighter, smoother, and more fluffy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>If your batch gets too hard to drop out nicely before you
have finished, it indicates that you either have cooked it too
long, or you did not work fast enough after you had mixed
in the bon-bon cream. But the chances are that you did not
work fast enough.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>VANILLA FUDGE.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2½ lbs. sugar.</li>
<li>½ lb. glucose.</li>
<li>1 quart cream or fresh milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose, cream (or milk) and the butter in
a kettle large enough to allow for its boiling up, set on the fire
and stir constantly, and when it comes to a good boil put in
the thermometer, see that the bulb is covered all the time,
and cook to 236 or 238, being careful to slide the thermometer
around the kettle occasionally, and stir where it stood
or it will stick. Then set off the fire, and cream (or rub) it with
a spoon against the sides of your kettle, until you see it just
commences to grain a little; add the vanilla, and it is then
ready to pour out, and it does not hurt this any to scrape the
kettle when pouring.</p>

<p>Most people pour their fudge into a buttered platter, but
the best way is to take a shallow square pan, or make a
square place on your slab with the iron bars, and lay into it
or into the pan, some old wax paper that has been used several
times for dropping purposes, and pour the candy directly
on it, and as soon as your fudge has set you can very easily
lift the paper out with the fudge, and it may be peeled off
without any trouble; in fact you may use any kind of a
heavy paper with a gloss on it, in place of the wax paper, and
you will find that this fudge will not stick to it at all. After
you pour the fudge out, it should be set in fifteen or twenty
minutes at the most, and then if you will take a knife and
mark it into squares any size desired, it will readily break
wherever marked, which is easier than cutting it up. If you
use a glossy paper instead of a wax paper upon which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pour it, it is best not to allow it to stand very long after it
sets, before removing the paper; but in using wax paper you
will have no trouble at all with it sticking. A shallow pan,
about nine by fifteen inches, will hold a batch this size, and
make it about the right thickness.</p>

<p>If the fudge gets sticky instead of creamy and is soft,
cook it two degrees higher the next time. You may dilute
condensed milk with one-half water, which may also be used
instead of cream, but in using sweet cream you get a nice
rich fudge, and there is not as much danger of its curdling.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE FUDGE.</h3>

<p>Use the recipe for Vanilla fudge, and make it in the same
manner, but do not add your chocolate until you take it from
the stove and commence creaming it. Then add enough
finely grated or chopped chocolate to give it a good chocolate
color, also add the tablespoon of vanilla to it, and you will find
that you have a much finer chocolate fudge than you would
have by cooking the chocolate in it, as most people do, and
also, they generally put too much chocolate in their fudge;
so only put enough in it to give it a good color. As this is
very hot when you put the chocolate in, it will readily melt,
and work through the batch while creaming it.</p>


<h3>BLACK WALNUT FUDGE.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of vanilla fudge, and when it is creamed and
just about to be poured out of the kettle, add a large handful
of black walnut meats, stir them through, then finish just the
same as the vanilla fudge.</p>

<p>You may also use any kind of nuts or candied fruit you
have, in the same manner, but black walnuts are considered
the best by the majority of persons.</p>


<h3>MAPLE FUDGE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1¾ pounds white sugar.</li>
<li>¾ pound maple sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 quart cream or fresh milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Put all this in a kettle and follow the directions for making
vanilla fudge, except be sure to cook this to 238. This
makes a fine eating piece of candy, if you add a handful of
pecans or English walnuts, just before you pour it out. If
you use maple syrup, as in making maple bon-bon cream, take
out a piece of glucose about the size of a whole English walnut,
(not more), before you start to cook.</p>


<h3>OPERA FUDGE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1 quart cream.</li>
<li>⅜ teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar and cream in kettle, set on hot fire, stir until
it commences to boil, then add the cream of tartar, and put in
the thermometer, and stir constantly but very gently until it
is cooked to 238, being sure to move the thermometer very
often with paddle, and stir underneath it, to prevent it from
sticking; then pour on slab, moistened a little previously, but
do not scrape out the kettle, and allow it to stand until it is
perfectly cold, then cream or turn it exactly as directed for
bon-bon cream, and when it works up into a hard ball, cover
with a damp cloth for about thirty to forty minutes, when
you will see that it has sweat enough so that it may be taken
in the hands and moulded up in any way desired, or may be
sliced down with the knife, cut into squares, and eaten at
once if you wish. If you wish you may add a good teaspoonful
of vanilla while creaming it, and thus have a vanilla fudge. If
you wish to make a chocolate fudge out of this, as soon as you
remove the damp cloth, take part or all of it, and work into
it, with your hands, by kneading it, enough melted chocolate
to color it well, then pat it out into a thin cake and put it
into a small box cover previously lined with wax paper,
smoothing it out to about three-fourths of an inch thick, then
set it away for several hours to harden a little. To remove it,
simply turn the lid over, letting it fall out, and then peel the
wax paper from it, and cut it up in small squares. Take the
remainder, after making part of it chocolate, and into it work
sufficient chopped nuts or chopped cherries and citron to show
up well, and if desired, color it pink and flavor with rose, and
mould up in the same manner as directed for chocolate fudge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
As you see, you may make this fudge any color or flavor you
desire; but the ones we have mentioned you will find about
the best. You have probably noticed that this fudge is made
about the same as bon-bon cream, only with this you do not
cover and steam it, and also must stir it constantly but gently,
or it will sugar for you. You will also notice that it takes
longer to cream up than it does bon-bon cream, and is very
stiff when you commence turning it, but do not notice that,
nor get discouraged, because if you cooked it to the required
degree, it will not fail to come out all right for you. You will
find that fudge will keep fresh for quite a while, if you put it
in a can or jar with a tight cover, and keep it in a cool dry
place.</p>

<p>If the fudge sugars for you, you will know that you have
either stirred it too much, started to cream it when too warm,
or disturbed it while cooling; try adding a pinch more of the
cream of tartar in your next batch.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to make the correct allowance, in case your
thermometer does not register 212 in boiling water.</p>

<p>If it should sugar and not cream up into a hard ball, it
must not be used for this fudge again, but add a little cream
to it, also a small amount of glucose, and make the plain
fudge out of it.</p>

<p>Don’t have the slab too wet when pouring out this fudge,
but just moist, as it is liable to throw your batch back a few
degrees.</p>

<h2>BROWNIES.</h2>


<p>Use the recipe for “Opera Fudge,” adding a tablespoonful
of vanilla extract when starting to cream the
batch. Follow the directions for making opera fudge exactly
until you have poured the batch on the slab to cool, and when
it is nearly creamed, pour on some melted chocolate and continue
to cream until the batch sets. When it sets in a hard
ball cover it with a damp cloth and allow it to sweat for
thirty or forty minutes. Knead it with the hands until it is
smooth, or if the chocolate, which you added while creaming
it, did not mix thoroughly, keep working it with the hands
until it is all mixed, adding more melted chocolate if necessary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sufficient chocolate should be used to make it a nice
brown color. Mould into balls at once, the size of a small
nutmeg, and lay them on wax paper to dry a little, and then
coat them in chocolate, and have someone lay a small round
dragee on top of them immediately after being coated. This
makes a swell topping piece for your Christmas boxes. You
may also dip them all, or just about half of them, in chocolate
bon-bon cream, as directed for dipping “Cocoanut Bon-bons,”
only you may have to let these last centers, those to be dipped
in the chocolate bon-bon cream, dry out a little longer than
those to be dipped in the chocolate, for if very soft, they might
break when being handled with the bon-bon fork. In making
your Christmas candies it would be well for you to dip them
this way and you will have a bigger assortment.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>VANILLA CARAMELS.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1½ pounds glucose.</li>
<li>3 pints cream.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and one pint of cream in the kettle,
stir constantly before, and also after it commences boiling,
until it will form in a soft ball when dropped in cold water.
There is no exact degree necessary to which to cook this.
Now add another pint of cream slowly, stir constantly and
cook again to a soft ball, then slowly add the last pint of
cream, and a piece of non-paraff about the size of a walnut, and
cook again, being careful to stir all over the bottom of the
kettle so that it will not stick, until it will form into a good
firm ball in cold water, but not brittle, remembering that your
caramels will be, when cold, the same consistency as this last
ball, so you can get it just about as you wish. It is very unhandy
to use a thermometer in making these, as they must be
stirred continually from the time you put them on the stove
until done. The non-paraff may be left out entirely if you
wish, as that is simply put in to make them retain their shape
after being cut up. In stirring it, do so very gently, but aim
to cover the whole bottom of the kettle. If you stir it hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they might possibly sugar for you, and your only idea in stirring
is to keep them from sticking. It is very essential to use
glucose in order to make a good caramel. If you should overcook
it and they are too brittle, or undercook it and they are
too soft, the batch may be put back in the kettle with a little
more milk or cream, and cooked again. If you have the iron
bars we mentioned, grease your slab thoroughly and lay the
bars on it so as to form a small square place. Then into your
candy, just after taking it off the stove, stir in the vanilla,
being careful not to stir it too much while adding this, but
just enough to mix it in good, and pour on slab between the
bars. Always make the square with the bars small enough
as you will want your candy to fill it up level full in order to
have your caramels the correct thickness, which should be
about three-fourths of an inch. If you have not made the
place large enough it is very easy to move one of the bars just
a trifle in order to hold all your candy. But if you made the
square too large, it is almost impossible to move the bars
closer together after pouring your candy out. If you do not
wish to use cream, you may use milk or part milk and part
cream. If you use all milk add a little butter after the batch
begins to boil. These caramels may also be made by simply
using only two pints of cream or milk and cooking them
twice, instead of three pints and cooking them three times,
but are not so rich. If your batch should happen to grain and
turn to sugar, put it back in the kettle with a little more glucose
and another pint of cream or milk, stir over a slow fire
to dissolve, then cook up as before. When these caramels
are set or cold, mark them in perfect squares with a knife
and one of the bars, then cut up with a large knife, in a sawing
motion. If the milk curdles, do not stop stirring and set
the batch off, but simply cook according to directions, and
the curd will not show. These caramels should be wrapped
in wax paper to prevent sticking together. The kettle may
be scraped lightly, when pouring these caramels out.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Use the recipe for vanilla caramels and, just after you
add the last pint of cream, add enough grated chocolate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
give it a good chocolate color, and finish the same, adding
the vanilla. Have the chocolate grated before starting to
cook.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>These caramels are very fine, especially when coated
with chocolate. Make same as the vanilla caramel, excepting,
when the batch is removed from the fire, color a deep red
and flavor with strawberry.</p>


<h3>NUT CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Any kind of nuts may be used. Hickory, almond, filbert,
English and black walnuts, are especially good. Chop the
nuts up a little with a knife, which makes them look prettier
when the caramels are cut, then add to the batch just before
pouring on the slab.</p>


<h3>MAPLE CARAMELS.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound maple sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound white sugar.</li>
<li>1½ pounds glucose.</li>
<li>3 pints cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow the directions exactly as given for vanilla caramels.</p>


<h3>FULL CREAM CARAMELS.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 pint milk or cream.</li>
<li>1 pint condensed milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful vanilla flavoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>A pint can of unsweetened condensed milk, will cost you
about ten cents, and can be purchased of most any grocer.
Condensed milk is an absolute necessity in this kind of a
caramel, for two reasons, namely: to get the peculiar flavor,
and to make it hold together, so that it need not be wrapped,
by which it is distinguished from the ordinary caramel. Mix
the sweet milk or cream and the condensed milk before starting
to cook, and in referring to this, we will simply use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
word milk. Put the sugar, glucose and one pint of the milk
in a kettle, stir and cook until it will form a soft ball when
dropped in cold water; then continue stirring and add one-half
pint of the remaining milk, pouring slowly, and cook up
again until it forms a soft ball, then slowly add the remainder
of the milk, being careful to stir all over the bottom of the
kettle so that it will not stick, and cook again until it will
form into a good firm ball in cold water, but not brittle, remembering
that your caramels will be, when cold, the same
consistency as this last ball, so you can get it just about as
you wish. Then take it off the fire, stir in the vanilla and any
kind of nuts you desire, and scrape it out of the kettle on a
greased slab, between bars, as directed for making vanilla
caramels. When cold, they may be cut up and either wrapped,
or just laid side by side on a slightly greased plate. If
you make these caramels to sell, it would be well to add a
piece of non-paraff about the size of an English walnut, when
starting to cook. You may also make this a chocolate caramel,
by adding enough grated chocolate, when you add the
last half-pint of cream, to give it a good chocolate color. Do
not have your fire too hot when cooking these, as they will
scorch very easily, and also, stir continually from the time
you start, till it is off the fire.</p>


<h3>MEXICAN GRAIN CARAMELS.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 quart sweet milk or cream.</li>
<li>1 pound center cream.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful vanilla extract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose, and one-half of the cream in a
kettle, stir and cook till it forms a soft ball when dropped in
cold water, add one-half of the remaining cream, cook up
again to a soft ball, then add the remaining half-pint of cream,
stir and cook till it forms a good hard ball in cold water. Set
off the stove, add the center cream and the vanilla, and stir in
good. Rub the batch against the sides of the kettle with the
paddle, until it gets pretty thick and grains, then pour out on
a greased slab between bars, and let harden. It does not hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to scrape out the kettle in making these caramels. After these
caramels are hard or set, cut up with a sharp knife, by drawing
it through the batch, instead of sawing as in other caramels,
and after they stand a few hours to dry, after being cut,
they may be piled up on a plate, as they will not stick together.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>TAFFY.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all this on hot fire, stir till it commences to boil, wipe
down sides of kettle with a damp cloth, cover and steam,
put in thermometer and cook to 260. Then pour on greased
slab, with bars around the edge to keep it from running off,
and just as soon as it commences to cool or stiffen up a little,
lift up the edges and fold toward center, and continue doing
this until it is cool enough to handle, then pull on the hook
until it is snow white. If you wish it vanilla, flavor by pouring
the vanilla over it while on the hook, a little at a time,
until you have it highly flavored. It is much easier to pull
taffy on a hook and also improves it greatly. We have told
you about the hook in the item regarding “tools.”</p>


<h3>HOW TO PULL TAFFY ON A HOOK.</h3>

<p>In pulling candy on a hook, first get it up in a ball on the
slab, after it has cooled, lay it on the hook and pull it down as
far as possible with both hands, then catch hold of the end
with one hand, and with the other hand take hold of the
batch about two thirds of the way up toward the hook, and
then throw the part between your hands up over the hook
with a quick motion, then pull batch down again and continue
in this manner until it is very white. It is best to pour the
flavoring on it when about half pulled, and it will work
through the batch by the time it is finished.</p>

<p>Use a little corn starch on the hands quite often while
pulling any kind of taffy, to keep them from sticking to the
taffy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not scrape out the kettle, except in making “Salt
Water Taffy,” and “French Chewing Taffy,” and then, not
too much as it will turn your batch to sugar.</p>

<p>If one of your batches should turn to sugar for you, you
will know that you have either turned in the edges too soon
or too often, or pulled it when too warm. It should be almost
cold when you start to pull.</p>

<p>You may substitute corn syrup for glucose in any of
these taffies, but you must use a little more than the recipe
calls for. Corn syrup is about ninety per cent glucose.</p>

<p>Wrap these taffies in wax paper if you wish to keep them
any length of time, and it will keep them from getting sticky.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY TAFFY.</h3>

<p>If you wish to make a strawberry taffy use the recipe for
plain vanilla “Taffy,” and while your batch is on the slab, add
enough damask rose coloring, to give it a good pink color;
but do not work the batch any more, in mixing in the color,
than in making plain vanilla taffy. Add the strawberry
flavor while pulling. With the exception of adding the color
to this, make it exactly the same as plain “Taffy.”</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE TAFFY.</h3>

<p>Use recipe and directions for making plain taffy, and
simply add grated chocolate to the batch just after you pour
it on the slab, and it will easily melt and work through while
folding it.</p>


<h3>MOLASSES TAFFY.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 pint dark molasses.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook sugar, glucose and water to about 245, steaming down
the same as others previously mentioned, and when it is up to
this degree, put in the molasses and butter, <b>stirring constantly
from this time on, and cook to 260</b>. Pour on greased slab and
pull same as others. If you wish nuts of any description in
either this or any of the other taffies, they may be added by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sprinkling them over the slab just before you pour the candy
out to cool.</p>


<h3>FRENCH CHEWING TAFFY</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1½ pounds glucose.</li>
<li>1 pint cream or milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 egg.</li>
<li>½ ounce gelatine.</li>
<li>Small piece paraffine wax.</li>
<li>Vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>First break the egg into the pint of cream and beat it thoroughly,
and in no case must the egg be put into the candy
except in this manner. Gelatine generally comes in one ounce
boxes, so you must use just the half of one of these. Put it in
a small dish or pan, and pour just enough warm water over
it to dissolve it; then set it on the stove where it will not
cook, but keep warm until needed. Now put sugar, glucose,
cream with egg beaten in it, butter, and piece of paraffine wax
about the size of a small walnut, into the kettle, set on fire and
stir constantly until it is done. When it commences boiling,
put in the thermometer and cook to 254, then take out thermometer,
and pour in gradually the dissolved gelatine, and
continue stirring until it boils up well again. It must be
cooked for about three or four minutes after it boils up with
the gelatine in it, then pour on well greased slab, which has
previously been sprinkled over thoroughly with black walnuts,
or you may use any other nuts you have, or in fact no
nuts at all, if you prefer, but you will find the black walnuts
greatly improve the flavor of the candy.</p>

<p>As soon as cool enough, fold in toward the center same
as other taffies, and when you can handle it nicely, put on the
hook and pull until you can pull it no more. It will be quite
dark in color while on the slab, but will pull to a nice, creamy
white color. This taffy will require considerably more vanilla
than other taffies; so flavor it very highly, by pouring the
vanilla over it while pulling. You will probably find this
candy sticky at times and if the batch is so, and should stick
to your hands while pulling it, loosen them with a quick jerk,
and you will find the candy will easily pull off, whereas if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
should attempt to loosen your hands slowly, you would not
have much success. If the batch should stick somewhat to
the slab, take your scraper and pry it up by hitting it very
quickly. In other words, simply scoop it up with the scraper,
but instead of pushing the scraper underneath it slowly, jab
it under very rapidly, and you will find you can readily get
the candy up in a ball. You will find this candy very hard to
pull if you do not use a hook. As soon as pulled sufficiently,
take off the hook by cutting it off close to the hook with a pair
of shears, then you may either lay it on a platter, put it in a
crock previously lined with wax paper, or lay it on your
kneading board and pull it out, a little at a time, into a strip
about one inch wide, then cut the strip crosswise into small
kisses about the size of your thumb, and when it is all cut up
in this manner, wrap each piece in tissue paper. The paper
will not stick to it in the least.</p>

<p>This candy is by far the finest taffy made, if you follow
these directions carefully, as it never gets very hard, and you
will be able to chew it a long time. Cutting it up into kisses,
while it may be a little more trouble, is by far the nicest
way to fix it.</p>


<h3>SALT WATER TAFFY</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1¼ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1¼ pounds glucose.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls salt.</li>
<li>½ ounce glycerine.</li>
<li>Butter size of a walnut.</li>
<li>1 pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and water in kettle, stir until it boils,
wash down sides of the kettle with a damp cloth, put in
thermometer and cook to 260. Set off stove, add butter, glycerine
and salt and stir in, then pour on a greased slab between
bars. Let cool, then pull on hook as directed for other
taffies, and flavor with vanilla while pulling. Be careful not
to scrape out the kettle too much in pouring it on the slab, as
it is liable to grain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3>BABY CREAM</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>¼ pound glucose.</li>
<li>½ pint cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and one pint water on fire and cook
to 260, then add the cream and cook up again to about 270. Stir
gently after adding the cream until done. Pour on greased slab,
and when cool enough, pull well on hook, and flavor and color
to suit while pulling. Cut up in kisses or small strips. It will
be nice and dry and mealy (inside) after standing a few hours.
It is not chewy like other taffy, and it is a fine hot weather
candy.</p>


<h3>CREAM TAFFY.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>1 pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, water and cream of tartar into a kettle
and cook to 275. Pour it on a greased slab and when cool
enough pull it over the hook. Handle the batch as little as
possible while cooling, and cool quickly so as to prevent it
from turning to sugar as there is no glucose in the taffy.
Flavor to taste. Pull out and cut in pieces. Wrap in wax
paper. After standing a few hours it will become very
creamy, retaining its shape, and not get sticky.</p>

<p>This is a summer taffy.</p>


<h3>ICE CREAM TAFFY.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 pint milk or cream.</li>
<li>Paraffine wax, size of walnut.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook all this at once, stirring constantly but very <b>gently</b>
from the time you put it on the stove until it is done. When
it commences boiling, put in thermometer and cook to about
256 or 258. Be careful to stir underneath thermometer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
prevent its sticking. When done, pour on slab, and when
cool, pull same as others and flavor with vanilla.</p>


<h3>PEPPERMINT RECEPTION MINTS.</h3>

<p>Use the above recipe for “Cream Taffy.” Flavor strong
with peppermint while on the slab. After the taffy has been
pulled, place it on a table or slab dusted with XXXX sugar.
Shape the batch round; pull it out in a long strip, cut into
small pieces as you pull it out, and roll them in XXXX sugar.
Leave the pieces spread out for a few hours. Place them in
an air tight jar where they will turn mealy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>BUTTERSCOTCH (BRITTLE).</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>⅜ pound butter.</li>
<li>¾ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and water in kettle on hot fire, stir
until it boils, wash down sides of kettle, then put cover on
until it steams well, remove cover and put thermometer in
and cook to about 300, then set kettle off the fire and put in
the butter, stirring it through the batch thoroughly, then put
the kettle back on the fire, and you must now stir it constantly;
but before you put the butter in it should not be
stirred. Just before you put in the butter, take out the thermometer,
as it is less trouble to stir the candy with the thermometer
out, and it does not need to be cooked to any exact
degree. In putting in the butter, you reduce the temperature
of the batch about fifteen degrees, and it is necessary to cook
it, after the butter is put in, up to about the point it was before;
but you will have no trouble with this, and as soon as
it boils up good and hard and commences to turn color a
little, drop some off the spoon very quickly in cold water, and
if it forms a mass of threads in the water it is done. Be very
sure to stir this well after the butter is in it or it will stick.
When done, set off the fire and add a good teaspoonful of
lemon extract, stir it in well and if you have a funnel, pour it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in the funnel, and drop on greased slab in wafers, which is the
nicest way to make this butterscotch; or you may pour the
whole batch, if you wish, on the greased slab, putting your
bars on edge of slab to keep it from running off, and let it run
over as large a surface as possible, as the thinner it is, the
nicer it will be. Mark it in squares, but do so very quickly, as
it does not take it long to harden; and always remember this:
that you must take your spatula or a long butcher knife, and
loosen the whole batch thoroughly from the slab before it gets
perfectly cold, as then it will not stick when cold and also
loosen the wafers. Your slab must be well greased before
pouring this on, but no matter how well you grease it, if you
allow the candy to get perfectly cold before loosening it, you
will find it will stick somewhat. In loosening this candy before
it gets cold, we do not mean to take it off the slab, but
just to simply run something under and loosen it, letting it
remain on the slab afterward, and you will find that it does
not stick.</p>


<h3>SOFT BUTTERSCOTCH</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>⅜ pound butter.</li>
<li>½ pint dark molasses.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful ground ginger.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and water on the fire, stir until it
boils, wipe down sides of the kettle, cover and steam same as
other recipe, remove cover, put in thermometer and cook to
about 245. You notice, probably, we say “about” in giving
degrees in some recipes, which means that if they are one or
two degrees either way, it does not hurt them. When the
batch is up to 245, put in the molasses, butter, and ginger, and
leave the thermometer in it and stir constantly, but not too
hard, and cook to about 260, then remove the thermometer,
and pour on greased slab and mark and cut up to suit. This
candy does not get brittle like the other, but is nice and
chewy; and if you put it in boxes, it must be wrapped in wax
paper, or the pieces will stick together. We may as well mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the fact here, that in most of these candies, you will find
that in hot weather, or rather on warm days, it is necessary
to cook them several degrees higher than it is on a very cool
day. This only applies to candies of this nature, which are
called hard boiled candies. In candies which are creamed up,
such as fondant, you do not make this distinction, as those
must always be cooked the same.</p>


<h3>PEANUT BRITTLE</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>¾ pound glucose.</li>
<li>2 ounces butter.</li>
<li>½ tablespoonful vanilla.</li>
<li>¾ pound peanuts. (Raw.)</li>
<li>1 heaping teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and water on hot fire and stir until it
commences boiling, wash down sides of kettle, cover until it
steams well, remove cover, and put in thermometer and cook
to 275, then take out the thermometer and put in the peanuts
and butter, and stir constantly after you put the peanuts in.
This of course will reduce the temperature of the batch, but
it will soon boil up, and must be cooked until the peanuts are
roasted, and the candy becomes a golden brown color, which
it does about the time the peanuts are roasted sufficiently.
Sometimes the peanuts will commence to pop, which indicates
that they are roasted about enough, but if they do not pop,
you can very easily tell when they are roasted sufficiently, as
a great many of them break open, and by lifting the paddle
occasionally with some of the peanuts on it, you can tell by
their looks if they are roasted or not. There is no exact degree
to which this second cooking must be done, but be careful
and do not let your batch get too brown. After making
one or two batches you will have no trouble in cooking it
correctly. The proper peanuts to use in this candy are the
small unroasted Spanish peanuts that we mentioned before.
Do not attempt to put roasted peanuts in this candy in this
manner but if you should use the roasted ones, they must be
stirred in after the candy is cooked, as they would burn black
if you put them in as we directed you in using the raw ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>This candy is intended only to be made with the unroasted
peanuts as directed, and if properly done, it is the
finest peanut brittle made.</p>

<p>When the peanuts are roasted, set off the fire and stir the
vanilla in well. Have your soda dissolved in just a very little
water, using only enough to cover it. Immediately after stirring
in the vanilla, pour in the dissolved soda and stir through
the batch thoroughly, which will cause it to foam up considerably
and get lighter in color. As soon as you have it
stirred enough so that the batch is thoroughly mixed and
foamy, pour on greased slab, and it will be necessary to <b>scrape</b>
the kettle out in making this candy.</p>

<p>Always have your slab warm before pouring this candy
on it, as it is cooked very high and will harden very quickly
if your slab is cold, which you do not want it to do. If you
stand your slab by the stove for a while, previous to making
the candy, it will warm it enough. After being on the slab a
very few moments, take hold of it all the way around the
edge, lift it so as to free it from the slab, then catch hold of
one side with both hands, one hand at each end of the batch,
and quickly flop the whole batch right over, just the same as
you would turn a pancake. Now commence around the edge
and stretch it, by pulling it out as thin as possible, and you
will find that the candy will stretch out very easily and leave
all the peanuts completely covered with the candy.</p>

<p>Always work very rapidly in doing this, and also work
around the edges first, as that hardens more quickly than the
center of the batch. If your slab is not large enough to hold
this candy after it is stretched out, as soon as you stretch part
of it, cut that off with a knife and lay it on some smooth
surface, so that the candy will be perfectly flat when cool, as
it looks better. By cutting it off as you stretch it, in this
manner, you will find that after you have worked around
the edges, your slab will probably be large enough to hold the
remainder of the batch after being stretched out. The thinner
you stretch this the nicer it will be, so try and do not
leave any thick places in it, and you will find you have the
finest peanut candy you ever tasted, being as brittle as glass,
and it may be eaten as easily as a soda cracker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In making this candy, you must have a kettle large
enough to allow for the foaming up, and a kettle holding two
and one half gallons will easily hold a batch just twice the size
of this. You will find it is very easy to flop the batch over,
if you loosen it first as we directed you. This is essentially a
cold weather candy, as it keeps brittle then, and is much
better.</p>


<h3>BLACK WALNUT BRITTLE</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>3 ounces butter.</li>
<li>1½ teaspoonfuls soda.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
<li>Black walnuts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook sugar, glucose and water same as in peanut brittle,
and when up to 275, remove the thermometer and stir in the
butter only, and not the walnuts. Continue stirring after the
butter is in until the candy is a golden brown color; then take
off the stove and stir in the broken walnut meats, as many as
you wish, but the more you put in the better it will taste.
Stir them in thoroughly, and also the vanilla; then stir in the
soda, the same as in peanut brittle, and pour out on greased
slab. Do not flop this batch over and stretch it, as it is not
necessary. As soon as batch is partly cool, mark in small
oblong pieces and when cold, it will break very easily. This
is very fine candy on account of the flavor the black walnuts
give it. It is also very fine coated with chocolate.</p>


<h3>FIG OR DATE BRITTLE</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
<li>Figs or dates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook sugar, glucose and water on hot fire to 275 or 280.
Then pour it on well greased slab or platter, which has previously
been covered with figs cut up, or dates with seeds removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
putting in just as many as you wish. You may also,
if you wish, use nuts of any description in place of the fruit,
or part of each. Just before pouring the syrup over them, stir
into it a good teaspoonful of vanilla, but do not stir it much
or it may sugar for you. When cold break up in small pieces.</p>


<h3>NUT BRITTLE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful essence of lemon.</li>
<li>1 pound nuts.</li>
<li>Butter size of a walnut.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the nuts in an oven. Put the sugar, glucose and
water into a kettle, stir until it begins to boil, and wash down
the sides of the kettle with a damp cloth; put in thermometer
and cook to 295. Turn out the fire and remove thermometer,
add the butter, salt and essence of lemon, and stir in well,
then stir in the warm nuts and scrape out on a greased slab.
After it has been on the slab about thirty seconds, turn the
batch upside down and commence pulling it out thin, as
directed in making peanut brittle. You may use any kind of
nuts in this, as they are all good in this kind of candy: English
walnuts, black walnuts, roasted peanuts, almonds, filberts,
pecans, or hickory nuts. This candy must be kept in air-tight
cans or jars in wet weather or it will become sticky.</p>

<h2>POPCORN CRISP.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>⅔ cup dark molasses.</li>
<li>2 ounces butter.</li>
<li>⅔ pint water.</li>
<li>Good pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook sugar, glucose and water to 280, in the same manner
as other candies; then take out thermometer and put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the molasses and butter, and a good pinch of salt, and stir
constantly after adding these. Cook until it is very brittle
when dropped in water or until you can distinguish it just
commencing to burn. Then take off the fire and pour it over
about ten quarts of popped corn, stirring it constantly as you
pour the syrup over it, so that it will all be covered, and as
soon as this is done, it is best to scoop it out of the pan and
spread it out on your slab somewhat, so that it will not pack
down any, which it would do if you allowed it to remain in
the pan. Before pouring this candy on the corn, it is best to
have your corn free from all the small hard grains, and put
the well popped ones in some very large pan before pouring
the syrup over it.</p>


<h3>SUGARED POPCORN</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ pound sugar.</li>
<li>4 quarts popped corn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar in a small kettle with just enough water to
dissolve the sugar, stir until it boils, put in thermometer and
cook to 222. Have the corn ready in a good sized kettle, and
as soon as the syrup is cooked, pour over the corn in a fine
stream. Have someone stir the corn while you pour the
syrup in it. Continue stirring briskly, until the corn separates,
and turn out on your work board or wax paper and immediately
pull the grains apart. You may also add a little red
or green color to the syrup before pouring it on the corn.
Have the corn slightly warmed in the oven, so that the sugar
syrup will grain easily.</p>


<h3>POPCORN BALLS</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 quarts popped corn.</li>
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose and water into a kettle and stir
until it commences to boil. Put in the thermometer and cook
to 240. Add vanilla. Pour the syrup slowly over the corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>,
stirring well. Moisten the hands with cold water and take
out the desired amount of corn, pressing it into a ball.</p>

<p>Maple sugar may be used instead of the white. For a variety,
color the white syrup pink and flavor with strawberry.</p>

<p>Have the corn slightly warmed in the oven, so that when
the batch is done cooking, you can get the corn and syrup
mixed good, and the balls moulded up before it gets too cold.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PEANUT BAR.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>2 pounds raw Spanish peanuts.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose and water in a kettle, stir until it
boils, wash down the sides of the kettle with a damp cloth
and cook to 240. Take out the thermometer and add the raw
peanuts and stir continually, until the batch turns a yellowish
color, and the peanuts pop and are roasted. Simply lift out
the paddle with a few peanuts on it occasionally, is a better
way to tell when the peanuts are roasted enough. Do not try
to get these peanuts too brown in the kettle, as they will roast
considerably after being poured on the slab, but just until
they turn a yellowish color and pop in the kettle. You must
stir the batch continually after you add the peanuts, and do
not use too hot a fire. They are liable to scorch a little but
if your fire is right and you stir them enough, they will be all
right. As soon as the peanuts are roasted, remove from the
fire, take out the paddle and scrape out of the kettle onto a
greased slab, between the bars. Take a knife and spread it
out even, so that it will fill all the corners of the square made
by the bars. Take a greased rolling pin, and run over the top
to smooth it down a little. When almost cool, run a knife
under the batch to loosen it from the slab. Then cut or saw
the batch in bars as desired, but do this while it is yet warm.
Have the raw peanuts ready so that when the thermometer
registers 240 you can take it out, put in the paddle and peanuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and start stirring immediately, and remember, if the fire
is too hot, but not allowed to just simmer, it is liable to
scorch the candy before the nuts are half roasted. It is best
to wrap this candy in wax paper, or put it in air-tight cans or
jars in wet weather. Do not make this candy in warm weather
and expect to get good results, as it is essentially a cold
weather candy.</p>

<h2>NOUGATINES.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>Butter size of a walnut.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful essence of lemon.</li>
<li>1½ pounds almonds or peanuts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roast the almonds in the oven, (or peanuts if you desire)
and chop fine, then set them where they will keep warm until
needed. Put sugar, glucose and one-half pint of water in the
kettle, set on fire, and stir until it commences to boil; then
take out paddle, wash down sides of the kettle and cook to
295. Set off the fire and remove thermometer, put in the butter
and essence of lemon, and stir in well. Have someone
add the warm nuts slowly, while you stir them in, and when
mixed good set the kettle back on the fire for a second or two,
to loosen the batch in the kettle, then scrape out on a greased
slab between bars, about three-quarters of an inch thick; roll
it out even between the bars with a rolling pin quickly, and
mark off into blocks three-eighths by one inch and cut while
still warm. You will have to watch very close, so that your
batch will not get too stiff before you get it cut up. You
must use a sharp knife and use a sawing motion while cutting,
as you cannot push the knife straight down and cut them
right. If your batch should happen to get too cold before you
get it cut up, hold it over the fire, turning it over to warm
both sides, until it softens or bends easily, then finish cutting.
This is an elegant piece, when dipped in chocolate, but they
must not be coated until they are perfectly cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOREHOUND CANDY.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1¾ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>¾ pound glucose.</li>
<li>½ pint horehound tea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and horehound tea, (the strength of
the tea will depend upon the individual taste) into a kettle,
stir until it boils, wash down the sides of the kettle with a
damp cloth, put in thermometer and cook to 295 to 300; when
it reaches that point, remove the thermometer and get it off
the fire as quickly as possible. Then pour on a greased slab,
with the bars set out far enough so that when the batch has
been poured out evenly, it will be about a quarter of an inch
thick. As soon as it cools a little, run a long knife underneath
the batch, to loosen it from the slab; then mark it into
squares any size desired, and keep going over the marks with
a knife until it is cold, then break up with the hands. Pack
in an air-tight jar and it will keep for a long time in a cool
place. This also may be wrapped in wax paper.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>GLACE NUTS.</h2>


<p>Take about one pound of granulated sugar and one small
tablespoonful of glucose, pour over it just enough water to dissolve
it well, stir until it commences boiling, wash down sides,
cover and steam, then remove cover, and cook without the
thermometer until it just starts to turn straw color. Do not
allow it to discolor any, but take it off the fire just at the moment
it commences turning color. If you wish, you may use
the thermometer in this and cook it to about 295, but you will
have no trouble in doing it without the thermometer. Have
your double boiler setting on the stove with boiling water
underneath it, or else have a small bowl in a pan of boiling
water in order that either of them will be very warm. Then
stir a few drops of lemon extract into your syrup which you
have just cooked, but do it very gently, then pour the syrup
into the double boiler and set it on the table and commence
dipping. Have handy your nuts, dates with seeds removed,
figs cut in small pieces, any kind of candied fruit, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
candied cherries, as they are very pretty prepared in this manner,
and proceed to dip them in this syrup in exactly the same
manner that we directed you to dip bon-bons, only in dipping
these fruits and nuts in this syrup, you must be very careful
and not disturb the syrup more than is absolutely necessary.
Just drop your nut in, and quickly lift it out and lay on a piece
of tin if you have it, or the bottom of a tin pan will do, as they
do not stick a particle to tin and will harden in a very few
seconds. Malaga grapes are also very nice dipped in this
manner. Marshmallows cut in two and dipped are also very
fine. Candied cherries are really the prettiest fruit that you
can dip in this manner, as they show up very nicely in decorating
a box. As soon as you see your syrup commencing
to get cloudy looking, you must stop dipping, and as quickly
as possible, scrape the remaining syrup out into a kettle, and
it may be used for making table syrup but must not be used
for this work again. It will be necessary for you to cook more
sugar in the same manner as you did before, if you are not
through dipping.</p>


<h3>GRILLED NUTS</h3>

<p>Take one pound of granulated sugar with enough water
to dissolve it, and cook with the thermometer, in the same
manner as other candies, to about 275, then set off the stove,
and pour into it as many filberts or hazelnuts as this will
cover, and stir them well until they sugar, and become very
white, which will be in a few moments. Have your nuts previously
roasted a little and the skins rubbed off. Do this by
putting them in a pan in the oven, watch them closely, and as
soon as they are nearly brown enough, take them out, and as
they brown considerably after taken out of the oven, you will
find, when cooled, they will be about right; but if you had
allowed them to get good and brown in the oven, they would
be roasted too much when cold. These are very fine eating,
especially for a luncheon or tea party and also look very
pretty if used in decorating your boxes. If some of them
should stick together when sugaring, break them apart before
serving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>ORIENTAL JELLY.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1½ pounds glucose.</li>
<li>2½ ounces Japanese gelatine.</li>
<li>1 quart boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the gelatine in pieces about one inch long, with a
pair of shears, and put into a kettle, and over this pour the
boiling water, then set aside. Put sugar and glucose into
another kettle and remember that this is the kettle you will
cook the batch in. Now take the kettle with the gelatine in,
and add enough warm water to cover the gelatine, which by
this time has puffed up quite a bit, and set on the fire and stir
until it starts to boil. Then turn out the fire and continue
stirring until it is dissolved, then strain this through a sieve
or collander, into the kettle which contains the sugar and
glucose. Now set the batch on the fire, stir and cook to 220.
Remember to stir this from the time you set it on the fire,
until it is cooked, and try to cover the whole bottom of the
kettle with the paddle while stirring to prevent scorching.
When the exact degree is reached, set it off the fire and let
stand about ten minutes, then add one-half teaspoonful essence
of lemon, and one and one-half pounds of ground figs,
and stir through. Prepare the slab by dusting it well with
XXXX sugar. Pour the jelly on the slab, between the bars,
about three-fourths of an inch thick. This size batch will fill
a place about twelve inches square. Sprinkle the top with
XXXX sugar and let it stand a few hours until it sets, when
it can be cut as desired. This jelly may be made any flavor
or color you want and you may want to change the flavors
occasionally. Here are a few: Color red when the batch is
cooked and flavor with strawberry. Color green and flavor
either mint or lime. Color orange and flavor the same. For
lemon, use no color and flavor lemon. Roll the pieces, after
being cut, in XXXX sugar and it can either be packed away
or eaten as it is. If your batch gets a little softer than you
like it, simply cook it two degrees higher the next time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE PUFFS.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs.</li>
<li>3 ounces water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar, glucose and water into a kettle, set on the fire,
stir until it commences boiling. Then take out the paddle
and wash down the sides of the kettle with a damp cloth, and
cook to 252. Beat the egg whites while this is cooking, or
better still, have someone beat them for you, and as soon as
the thermometer registers 252, take the kettle off the fire.
Put the well beaten egg whites into a pan and have them
ready, then take your paddle or spoon and rub the candy
against the sides of the pan, until the batch looks a little
cloudy or shows white streaks, being careful not to work it
too long, then put the paddle into the kettle with the eggs,
and pour slowly about one-half of the batch into the eggs,
and have someone stir the eggs continually while pouring.
Then immediately put the paddle back into the other kettle,
and pour the eggs into the kettle with the plain syrup, stirring
the syrup continually. The kettle which held the eggs
may be scraped out clean, but you must remember to do this
double mixing as quickly as possible or the syrup is liable to
sugar and harden for you before you get it mixed. Continue
beating, and when it begins to stiffen a little, add one-half
teaspoonful of essence of pineapple, and about a handful of
candied pineapple, cut fine. When stiff enough to handle,
drop out on wax paper or buttered plates in the following
manner: With a large spoon, take a spoonful from around
the edge, where it stiffens first and with a fork push off small
portions of it onto the wax paper or plates. It should harden
in a short time after being dropped. If it is slow in stiffening
in the kettle, let it stand a few minutes. It should be stiff
enough to stand and not flatten, when dropped on the paper.
Do not allow the syrup to cool before starting to grain the
batch in the kettle, but start rubbing it against the sides of
the pan as soon as you take it off the fire. If the puffs are too
hard, cook them two degrees lower, the next time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3>NUT PUFFS</h3>

<p>Use the recipe for Pineapple Puffs, and simply add the
nuts in place of the pineapple, and vanilla flavor instead of
the essence of pineapple. Hickory nuts or pecans are considered
the best.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHERRY BOUNCE.</h2>


<p>Make the same as pineapple puffs, using candied cherries
and vanilla flavor in place of the pineapple fruit and flavor.
This may also be colored a delicate pink and are fine when
dipped in chocolate.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>MEXICAN PENOCHE.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds light brown sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 quart cream or fresh, rich milk.</li>
<li>1½ pounds bon-bon cream.</li>
<li>1 pound nuts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose and cream into a kettle, stir until
it boils, then put in thermometer, keep stirring and cook to
234. Set off the fire and add the bon-bon cream and beat
until the bon-bon cream is all melted, and the batch stiffens
a little. Chop the nuts a little and work them in the batch.
Beat slowly until the candy is stiff enough to stand and not
flatten out when dropped on wax paper or buttered plates,
then spoon out as directed in dropping pineapple puffs. English
walnuts are the standard nuts to use for penoche, but
pecans or hickory nuts are excellent. If you do not use fresh
milk or cream, your batch is very liable to curdle. If you
keep stirring it continually and do not let it stand, you may
even prevent it from curdling at all. But if it should, you
will know that the milk or cream was not fresh. If it curdles,
cook it up just the same, and while not being as smooth, will
taste all right.</p>

<h2>ICED SHELL BARKS.</h2>


<p>Melt some fondant in a double boiler and flavor it with
vanilla. Choose perfect halves of shell bark nut meats. Dip
each nut meat in the cream, giving it a thin coat. Drop them
on wax paper. After they are all dipped in this manner, put
some fresh fondant in the double boiler and heat the cream
just enough so that you can use it for dipping. Flavor with
vanilla. Dip them a second time and drop them on wax
paper.</p>


<h3>ICED LEMON WALNUTS</h3>

<p>Melt some fondant in a double boiler. Color a light yellow
and flavor with grated rind of lemon. Choose perfect
halves of white English walnuts. Dip them into the fondant
and drop them on wax paper. If they are not coated sufficiently
thick, dip them a second time. One dipping is usually
sufficient.</p>

<h2>TURKISH NOUGAT OR ALAKUMA.</h2>


<h3>First Batch</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1¼ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
<li>Whites of 5 eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, water and cream of tartar into a kettle,
set on the fire, and stir until it commences to boil, then take
out the paddle and wash down the sides of the kettle with a
damp cloth, put in the thermometer and cook to 248. Have
someone beat the egg whites stiff, so that they will be ready
when this batch is done cooking. Put the egg whites in a
kettle large enough to hold the eggs and both of these batches,
and allow room for beating. Have the eggs in the kettle
ready, and as soon as the batch reaches 248, remove the thermometer
and get the batch off the fire as quickly as possible,
so that the batch does not cook up one or two degrees while
you are doing this, as that is sufficient to spoil the whole
thing. As soon as the batch is cooked and off the fire, pour
at once very slowly, into the beaten egg whites, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
someone stir the egg whites while you are pouring, in order
to mix the batch with the eggs thoroughly, but do not let the
syrup drip out, and under no circumstances scrape out the
kettle after it is all poured out and will not run out easily or
in a fine stream. Continue stirring the eggs for a minute,
then stop stirring, and let it stand undisturbed until you pour
in the second batch. Do not wash out the kettle after the
first batch is done, but set it on the scales the way it is, then
weigh up the second batch and cook at once.</p>


<h3>Second Batch</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>1½ pounds glucose.</li>
<li>½ pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set on the fire, stir until it boils, wash down sides of the
kettle, put in the thermometer and cook to 258. Take out the
thermometer quickly and get off the fire, as directed in the
first batch, and immediately pour slowly into the first batch
with the eggs, stirring the egg batch continually, and it does
not hurt to scrape out the kettle a little in this last batch.
Now beat the batch until it begins to get a little stiff, then
add a good tablespoon of vanilla flavor; keep beating until it
gets pretty thick and then add about one and one-half pounds
of English walnuts, candied cherries and pineapple cut fine,
or just walnuts alone. Mix through well and scrape out of
the kettle into a small bucket or a deep bread pan, which has
been previously lined with rice paper. This paper need not
be taken off but can be eaten right with the candy. After
it has stood for a few hours it may be cut up as desired. If
your batch is a little too dry, but not too hard, add a trifle
more glucose than the recipe calls for, the next time. Keep
this in a crock, with a damp cloth on top of the crock, and it
will stay fresh a long time. This is an elegant piece, when
coated in chocolate.</p>

<h2>FRUIT LOAF.</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>¾ pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 pint water.</li>
<li>Whites of 3 small eggs.</li>
<li>1½ pounds nuts and fruit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose and water into a kettle and set on
the fire. Stir until it begins to boil, wash down the sides of
the kettle with a damp cloth, put in the thermometer and
cook to 254. Have someone beat the egg whites stiff and put
them into another kettle and have them ready. As soon as
the thermometer registers 254, take off the fire quickly and
begin at once to rub the syrup against the sides of the kettle,
to grain it a little, occasionally splashing the batch up against
the sides to wash down that which is creaming. When the
batch begins to look cloudy and shows white streaks, stop
graining, put the paddle into the pan with the eggs, and commence
pouring slowly about one-half of the syrup into the
eggs, stirring the eggs while pouring, then immediately pour
the eggs back into the syrup, stirring the syrup very fast.
Scrape out all the eggs and syrup that sticks to the pan that
originally held the eggs, and keep beating the batch. Scrape
down the syrup that splashes on the sides of the kettle occasionally,
and beat until it begins to stiffen a little, then add
a teaspoonful of vanilla and a teaspoonful of orange flower
water. Beat through well, then add about a pound and a
half of almonds, walnuts, candied cherries and pineapple, cut
fine. Mix in well and scrape out of kettle into a pan which
has been previously dusted with XXXX sugar and let set a
few hours. When set or hard cut up in pieces weighing about
thirteen ounces, shape round and long with flat ends about
two inches thick, dusting with XXXX sugar. Then dip in
milk chocolate and when the chocolate hardens, cut up as
desired. Do not grain the batch too much before pouring
into the eggs or it will harden before you can get it mixed.
You can also use your own judgment about the kind of nuts
or fruit you like, but we simply tell you to use candied fruit
and nuts together as that seems to be the most popular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3>STUFFED DATES</h3>

<p>Remove the seeds from the dates. Color and flavor some
fondant. Form it by rolling it in small pieces and lay it in
the date; press it together firmly. Dust with XXXX sugar.
Pistachio flavor with a delicate color of green is especially
nice.</p>


<h3>NUTTED DATES</h3>

<p>Remove the seeds from the dates and fill them with nuts;
press together firmly and roll in granulated sugar.</p>


<h3>CANDIED ORANGE PEEL</h3>

<p>Keep the peel of the fruit as you use it, in a weak brine
until enough has collected to preserve. Wash it thoroughly
in several waters. Let it boil in plenty of water until tender,
changing the water several times. If the peels are fresh, they
need be boiled in one water only. When they can be pierced
with a straw, drain off the hot water. Let them cool and
scrape out the white pulp with a spoon. Make enough syrup
to cover the yellow peels, using the proportion of a pound of
sugar to a pint of water. When the syrup is boiling, drop in
the peels and let them cook slowly until they are clear. Then
boil rapidly until the syrup is reduced to dryness, using care
that it does not burn. Spread the peels on a flat dish and
place them in a warm place to dry for 12 hours or more. When
perfectly dry pack them into preserve jars. They are cut into
shreds and used in cakes, puddings, and wherever raisins and
citron are used. The boiled peel may be cut into shreds before
being cooked in the syrup.</p>


<h3>SPINNING SUGAR</h3>

<p>Although spinning sugar has been called the climax of
the art of sugar work, you need not be deterred from trying
it. It cannot be made on a damp day or in a moist atmosphere.</p>

<p>Spun sugar makes a beautiful decoration for ice creams,
glace fruits and other cold desserts.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup water.</li>
<li>½ saltspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Put the sugar, water and cream of tartar into a kettle and
stir until it commences to boil. Wipe down the sides of the
kettle and steam. Put in the thermometer and cook to 310.
Care must be used so that it does not burn. Remove it from
the fire. Place the pan in a pan of cold water to stop the
boiling, because the heat of the pan and sugar might cause it
to boil higher.</p>

<p>Place two of the steel bars (which you use for the slab)
on a table so that the ends project a little way; spread some
papers on the floor under them. For spinning, two forks may
be used, but some wires drawn through a cork are better because
they give more points. After the syrup has cooled a
little; take the pan in the left hand, the wire or forks in the
right; dip them into the syrup and spin it over the rods, and
on the return motion, under the rods; fine threads of sugar
will fly off the points and remain on the rods. If the syrup
gets too cold, it may be reheated. Take the spun sugar carefully
off the rods from time to time and fold it around a pan
turned over, or roll it into nests or any form desired. Place
the spun sugar under a glass globe as soon as made. Under
an air tight globe with a piece of lime, it may be kept crisp
for a day or two, but it readily gathers moisture, and it is
better to make it the day it is to be used. Do not attempt to
make it on a damp or rainy day, and do not have a boiling
kettle in the room.</p>


<h3>SALTED ALMONDS</h3>

<p>Put one tablespoonful butter in your kettle, for each pint
of nuts you have, and set the kettle on the stove until the butter
melts and is very hot, then put the nuts in the kettle with
the butter, and stir constantly until nearly done, or brown
enough, as they cook somewhat after taking off the stove,
then sprinkle well with salt, and pour them out in a sieve
which has been set over a pan, so as to allow any remaining
butter to run off. If you wish, you may first blanch your
almonds by pouring boiling water over them, and then rubbing
off the skins, as you all know how.</p>

<p>You will find these nuts far nicer, when roasted and salted
in this manner, than by doing it in the oven, as they are more
brittle and nicer in every way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<h3>SALTED PEANUTS</h3>

<p>Use the raw Spanish peanuts, without blanching them,
and roast and salt in the same manner as directed for almonds.</p>

</div>

<p>Dainty looking candy may be spoiled in packing, and
what would be a nice appearing box of candy loses its charm
because it is not packed with care and taste.</p>

<p>Candy boxes may be bought in almost every town, but
if you have saved some that you have received, these may be
used as well. Paste an appropriate postal card over the name
of the firm on the lid.</p>

<p>Line the box with wax paper and cut it so that it will be
large enough to fold over the top of the full box of candy.</p>

<p>Put chocolates, fudge and creams in the bottom of the
box. If you have made some of the brittles, you will find
them very convenient to fill in hollows so that the bottom is
level.</p>


<h3>Cut a piece of white cardboard to fit between the layers.
Bristol board or two pieces of heavy writing paper will answer
the purpose. Fold the strips of white paper, as illustrated.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Illustration on previous page will give you a good idea
how to arrange the candy in diagonal rows. Be very careful
not to put rows of candy near each other which do not harmonize.
Fill in the corners of the box with coated nuts, grilled
nuts and candied cherries so that it looks well filled.</p>

<p>Ornament the top of the box with crystalized mint and
rose leaves, crystalized violets, large silvered dragees and
chocolate coated nuts wrapped in tin foil; two or three is
sufficient for one box.</p>

<p>Fold over the wax paper, and cover the box with a candy
box lace. Tie a piece of embroidery floss, white, around the
box and put on the lid.</p>

<p>Cut white paper the correct size of your box, making it
long enough so that when the ends are folded up they will
just come to the top of the box. Tie the box with gilt cord.</p>

<p>Sometimes bon-bons with a soft center are put in bon-bon
cases, which adds to the appearance of the box.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CENTER CREAM</h2>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2½ pounds sugar.</li>
<li>½ pound glucose.</li>
<li>1 pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, glucose and water in the kettle and set on
hot fire. Stir this and wipe down sides of kettle same as bon-bon
cream, and when it starts to boil, cover until it steams
well, remove cover, put in thermometer, and cook to 238, then
remove from the fire and pour on slab which has previously
been moistened a little. You will see that so far, you handle
this the same as bon-bon cream, but it is not necessary to
use quite so much care with it, as the glucose in it has a tendency
to keep it from sugaring any, but do not get careless with
it simply because we tell you this. This fondant must not
stand until perfectly cold, but commence creaming it when
about half cold, and cream it in the same way that you do
bon-bon cream. It is better to scoop this fondant off into
your crock just before it sets firmly. When you see it is up
to that point, quickly scoop it into the crock, for if you allow
it to remain on the slab until it sets perfectly hard, and sweat
it same as bon-bon cream, it is very sticky to handle. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should happen to scoop it into the crock a few seconds too
soon, it does not matter, as it will come out just the same in
the end. It will take longer to cream this fondant than it
does bon-bon cream. When you put it in the crock, cover
with a damp cloth the same as the other. This is a snow
white, very soft, smooth, and sticky fondant, and is used for
the centers of chocolate creams, as it makes a much softer
center for them than bon-bon cream does. We will tell you
farther on how to handle it, but always remember, we will
speak of this as <b>center cream</b> and the other, bon-bon cream.</p>


<h3>MAPLE CENTER CREAM</h3>

<p>Make exactly same as above, only instead of white sugar,
use two-third maple and one-third white. If you use maple
syrup instead of maple sugar, allow two pounds of syrup for
every pound of sugar desired. You will find this cream very
sticky, and it takes longer to cream it up than the other, but
it makes a delicious chocolate cream. Do not get discouraged
and think it is not going to cream for you, for if you cooked it
to the right degree, it will never fail to cream.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MOULD IN CORNSTARCH.</h3>

<p>As you use the center cream for the inside of chocolate
creams, you must have some method of moulding them on
account of that cream being so soft and sticky. This is done
in cornstarch, the same kind as you use for cooking purposes,
as that does not stick to the candy in the least. Get the
cheapest grade possible, as that answers the purpose. It
should cost you from five to eight cents a box, and we would
advise you to get four or five boxes at once, as it never spoils
and may be used indefinitely, over and over again. When you
are through with it, scoop it out into a large jar until you
need it again.</p>

<p>Take a square, shallow pan, from one-half to one inch
deep, or a pie pan will answer the purpose as well, and <b>sift</b>
starch into it until you have enough in to fill it. Then with a
smooth stick that extends over each side of the pan, smooth it
off very even. By having the stick extend over edges of the
pan, you will not pack the starch down, which is very necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to avoid, as you cannot make your impressions perfect
if your starch is packed in the least, and consequently this
starch must be <b>sifted</b> into the pan and not scooped in. In
smoothing it off, place your stick on the pan at one end and
push it across, and in that manner you will not pack the
starch in the least. Now take your stick with the style of
moulds glued on you intend using, take hold of each end of
it, and press the moulds down into the starch until the stick
strikes the sides of the pan; carefully raise the stick and you
will then find your impressions in the starch ready to be filled.
Continue in this manner until you have the pan full of impressions,
always remembering that every time you make a
new row of impressions, you must, when pressing the moulds
down in the starch, press away from the ones you just made,
the least trifle, so you will not spoil them, as this cornstarch
is very treacherous, and if you should happen to press the
moulds the least bit toward the impressions previously made,
you would cause them to cave in. By having the ends of your
stick protrude over the edges of the pan as directed, you will
thus get all the impressions the exact depth. You must be
<b>very careful</b> and do not jar the table a particle or attempt to
move the pan before filling the impressions with center cream,
for if you do, you are liable to spoil them.</p>

<p>Take as much center cream as you wish, and put it into
the double boiler with hot water underneath it, set on the fire
and stir until it melts, and do not allow any water to get in
with the cream. As soon as it is thin, color and flavor any
way you wish, and let it remain on the stove until it gets good
and hot. It must be hot or it will not harden in the starch,
but remember the hotter you get it, the harder it will be after
it is cool, and as you do not wish them to be too hard, be
careful and not allow it to get too hot. The best way to test this,
is to take some out upon your spoon and touch your tongue
to it and if it is very warm it is ready to use. Now set off
the stove, but do not take the inside boiler with the cream in
it out of the water, as it must be kept warm. Dip a little out
in a spoon and pour it into the impression. In doing this
you will soon get an idea about how much to dip out each
time in the spoon in order to fill the impression. If you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dipped out too much to fill it, as soon as it is full, quickly
turn the spoon up, as you only want the impression level full.
Continue in this manner until you fill them all. You must
work rapidly, and will soon be able to drop the cream in the
impressions without striking the edges and breaking them
down. If you use a funnel to drop these centers, you must
warm it a little over a fire, but do not get it hot, just warm;
then take the handle of the funnel in your left hand, and with
your right hand push the stick down into the end of the funnel,
and have someone else pour the heated center cream into
the funnel. Hold the end of the funnel over one of the impressions
in the starch, and lift the stick with your right
hand, allowing enough cream to run into the mould to fill it.
Continue in this manner till all have been filled. If the
cream becomes too thick to run out of the spoon, or funnel,
readily, set it back on the stove a few moments, until the
water under it boils again, then it will be thin enough to run
out as before. If you made this cream correctly in the first
place, it will never be necessary to add any water to it in order
to have it run out of the spoon; but in case you misread
your thermometer and cooked it a little too much, it may
be so thick that it will require a few drops of water, but add
very little. In from ten to twenty minutes, the centers will
be hard enough to pick out of the starch and blow off. Very
little of the starch will stick to them as you lift them out, but
what does will blow off easily. You may do this with your
mouth, or better still, if you have any kind of a small bellows
in the house, put the centers in a pan as you take them from
the starch, and when they are all taken out, squeeze the bellows
on them several times, and they are perfectly clean.
In blowing this starch off, we would advise you to take them
outdoors and do it, as the starch makes quite a dust in the
kitchen. They are now ready to coat with chocolate, and do
this as directed in article on Chocolate Coating.</p>

<p>All chocolate creams are moulded in this manner, excepting
Orientals. You may make these any shape or size centers
that you have moulds for. These centers should be
coated within several hours after being moulded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>If you wish chopped nuts of any kind in the centers, stir
them in well, just before you commence dropping them in the
starch, or you may if you wish, drop a large piece or a whole
half of a nut in each impression, then pour the cream on top
of it.</p>

<p>If you use a funnel, and wish to use nuts in the centers,
do not add the nuts to the cream before being run in the
starch, but simply drop them in the empty mould before hand,
and run the cream on top, till it fills the mould.</p>

<p>If they do not harden in the starch, it is because of the
water you added or else because you did not get the cream
hot enough, and they may be picked out, blown off, and re-melted
again without hurting the cream in the least. These
centers will mellow up a great deal after being coated with
chocolate, and are better after they stand a few days.</p>

<p>If you should have more cream melted up than you have
impressions made for, you may flavor it highly with wintergreen
or peppermint, and with a spoon, drop it out in wafers.</p>

<p>While it really does not come under this heading, we will
say here that centers moulded in this manner and coated with
bon-bon cream make a very nice cheap bon-bon, but are not
to be compared with the ones made after the style we direct
you to, in article on Bon-Bon Making. A great many confectioners
never make bon-bons in any other manner than this,
but you will see the others are much finer.</p>

<p>It is a failing of many persons to heat the center too hot
so that it will run through the funnel more readily, but the
result is a hard center that will never get soft, and nothing
can be done to soften it after it is once hard. A chocolate
center becomes soft within three or four days.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>You may make them any flavor or color you desire. You
may, if you wish, roll bon-bon cream up into balls and coat
them with chocolate, but this does not make a nice chocolate
cream, and the proper way is to mould the centers in cornstarch
as directed, using the center cream for this purpose.
Either rose, wintergreen, peppermint, strawberry, vanilla, or
lemon make a fine chocolate cream. It is best to make each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
flavor a different shape. Color the rose, strawberry, and
wintergreen a delicate pink and the lemon a deep yellow. The
vanilla should be left uncolored, and you may put chopped
nuts in any of these in the manner we directed, in article on
Cornstarch Work.</p>

<p>When moulded, blow off the starch, and coat with chocolate
as directed in article on Chocolate Coating. If you desire
a nut on the top of any of your chocolates make a flat
shaped center, and put the nut on before the chocolate sets,
and press down very gently, so as not to make a base on
them. Maple chocolates, made from maple center cream in
this manner, are very fine. English walnuts, pecans, or almonds,
blanched and split in two, are the prettiest nuts for
this purpose; however, we do not advise putting nuts on chocolate
creams, except on rare occasions, as you will notice the
finest grades of chocolate creams do not have nuts on them.</p>

<p>If you are able to purchase any silver dragees, which are
kept only in large candy stores, they are very pretty on the
tops of chocolate creams. As you see by this, there is no
limit to the many different styles of chocolate creams possible
to make, by adopting any ideas you have of your own and
following this recipe.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE MARSHMALLOWS.</h3>

<p>Buy your marshmallows, as that is cheaper and much
easier than making them, and coat them with chocolate the
same as chocolate creams. If they are very large, it is best
to cut them in two before coating, as they will look prettier.
Pistachio nuts, chopped very fine and sprinkled over them
before the chocolate sets, look very nice.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Make some caramels, either vanilla or strawberry flavor,
which are the best for this purpose, and coat same as directed
for other chocolates.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE DATES.</h3>

<p>Remove the seeds from dates, roll them up, and coat with
chocolate as directed. If you stuff these dates with chopped
hickory nuts after removing seeds, then press firmly together
and coat with chocolate, they are very fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE FIG PASTE.</h3>

<p>Buy some fig paste or Oriental jelly, and coat with chocolate
same as others, and you will find it makes a very fine
piece of candy.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE COATED FUDGE.</h3>

<p>Cut freshly made fudge up in squares and coat with
chocolate. Chocolate fudge, coated in this manner, is probably
better than the other flavors. Opera fudge, cut into
squares and coated with chocolate, is much nicer than the
other kind of fudge.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE WAFERS.</h3>

<p>Drop out some wintergreen or peppermint wafers in the
manner described before, only use center cream instead of
bon-bon cream, then coat with chocolate. It is best to use
the center cream in making these, as it mellows up more after
being coated than bon-bon cream, as it is much softer.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE WALNUT BRITTLE.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of walnut brittle as directed, and cut into
oblong pieces about one inch long, then coat with chocolate.
These are very brittle and nice eating.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CHERRIES.</h3>

<p>Select large candied cherries, and coat with chocolate
same as other centers. These are probably the finest chocolates
you can make, and also the most expensive, and I
would advise you to only use them in dressing off the top
layer of your boxes.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE NUTS.</h3>

<p>Either English walnuts, pecans, or Brazil nuts are very
fine when coated with chocolate. Do it in the same manner as
other chocolate coating, but do not roast these nuts before
coating them.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE ALMONDS.</h3>

<p>Roast the almonds in the oven, being careful about getting
them too brown, and when cool, coat with chocolate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Never coat nuts of any description with anything but <b>sweet</b>
coating; if you should use chocolate on them that is the least
particle bitter, they would not taste good at all. The best
way to coat these small nuts, is to work your chocolate, then
put in quite a number of the nuts, roll them around a little,
then with a pair of tweezers, lift them out one at a time and
lay on your oilcloth. This is much quicker than lifting them
out with your hands, one at a time.</p>


<h3>FILBERT PYRAMIDS.</h3>

<p>Roast the filberts in the oven, same as you do other nuts,
then coat with chocolate, and in laying them on the oilcloth,
lay three of them in the form of a triangle so that they will
touch each other, then lay another one on top and when the
chocolate is set, they will stick firmly together and look very
pretty in a box. If you have a pair of tweezers, they are very
convenient with which to pick the nuts out of the chocolate,
and lay them so that they will touch each other. In laying
the last filbert on top, if you will allow quite a little chocolate
to stick to it as you lift it out, it will improve the looks of
the pyramid, as it will run down over the other nuts.</p>


<h3>PECAN FRITTERS.</h3>

<p>Pour out a little chocolate coating, work it until nearly
cold, then mix into it broken pecan meats until it is pretty
thick, then with a spoon drop it in the form of patties on the
oilcloth, and make them about the size of a silver dollar.
Have enough nuts mixed in the chocolate so that they will be
thick enough to hold their shape after being dropped out and
will not spread any, and consequently they will be very rough
looking, which they should be. These are about the finest
candy in this line which it is possible to make, providing of
course that you use the Sweet Coating for this purpose.</p>


<h3>PEANUT FRITTERS.</h3>

<p>Make them in the same manner as pecan fritters. Always
use roasted peanuts, and if you have the raw Spanish
peanuts, roast them in the oven first, as they are better than
the large peanuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE COATED PINEAPPLE.</h3>

<p>Cut some candied pineapple into points and coat with
chocolate.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE COATED KISSES.</h3>

<p>Molasses and Moonlight Kisses are greatly improved
when coated with chocolate. Cut the kisses into pieces about
two inches long and coat with chocolate.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE NABISCOS.</h3>

<p>Buy a few Nabisco wafers, cut them in four pieces and
dip in sweet chocolate.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE COCOANUT.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of cocoanut centers as given in this book,
roll them round and dip in chocolate. This makes a nice
topping piece for your boxes. You may also set a small
round dragee on top of the ball, while the chocolate is still
warm.</p>


<h3>MARASCHINO CHERRIES.</h3>

<p>Drain the liquor from red or white Maraschino cherries.
Melt some fondant, and dip each cherry in the melted fondant.
It is well to add a little of the liquor to the fondant
while melting, as this has a tendency to make the fondant
watery in about a day. As soon as you have dipped all the
cherries, and the fondant on them has cooled, commence at
once to coat with chocolate. If after you have finished coating,
and you find little drops of syrup standing out on the
chocolate coated cherries, simply cover these holes with a
little cooled chocolate and it will stop at once; for if allowed
to drop out, the cherries would be dry in a few days. These
are best wrapped in wax paper.</p>

<h2>HOW TO COAT CHOCOLATES</h2>


<p>For coating chocolates, confectioners use what is called
“Sweet Coating Chocolate,” which is prepared expressly for
this purpose, and you will be able to purchase it of any confectioner
who makes his own candy, or any candy supply
house, if you live convenient to one, and also in some of the
large grocery stores.</p>

<p>There are a great many different grades of coating chocolate,
and we strongly encourage using a good chocolate, as
the better grades give the best results; because there is less
sugar in it, and it lends itself more readily to the manipulations,
gives a more glossy finish, and has a much richer taste
than the cheaper chocolates, which are adulterated. Chocolate
which sells for about forty cents a pound is a good quality.
You may, if you are unable to procure this coating, use
the ordinary cooking chocolate, which you will find in all
grocery stores. This is not so nice or satisfactory to use as
the other coating, and if you use it, we would advise you to
add enough XXXX sugar, after it is melted, to sweeten somewhat,
and also to thicken it which improves it. In writing
these directions, we take it for granted you will use the sweet
coating, and will write them accordingly; but if you should
use the cooking chocolate, handle it in the same manner.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A FEW PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS.</h2>


<p>The condition of the weather plays an important part in
candy making, especially in the chocolate coating. Never
attempt to coat on a rainy day, as the moisture in the air,
prevents the chocolate from setting quickly, and the chocolates
become grey. Dry weather is by far the most satisfactory,
as the chocolate is easier to handle, works better, and
coats with more luster.</p>

<p>As no doubt you will do the most of your chocolate work
in the winter time, you must pay strict attention to the conditions
under which you work. To begin with, the temperature
of the room in which you work, must be about 75. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
not attempt to coat in a room that is cold, for your chocolate
will harden on your hands and on the slab, before you can
get it worked enough. The room should at least, be comfortable
enough to sit in. Let us caution you right here, not
to have your slab, nor the centers to be dipped, too cold. Warm
the slab a little, before you pour the chocolate on it, but be
careful not to get it hot, just warm enough to take the chill
off. The centers, or whatever you are going to coat, should
not be heated, but by merely leaving them set in the same
room for awhile, they will be about right. Remember, it is
just as bad to dip freshly run centers, or anything that has
just been made, while they are still warm, as it is to dip the
cold ones; the heat must have left them entirely before you
coat them, or they will be grey and streaked. If you dip
in warm weather, you will have to cool the chocolates in a
refrigerator for about five or ten minutes. That is, when
you have dipped about a dozen pieces of candy, you must set
them in the refrigerator, so that the chocolate on them will
harden quickly. In cold weather you will not have to use
a refrigerator, but you must set the chocolates in a cool place
as soon as you have about a dozen pieces coated. In real cold
weather they may harden very quickly after being placed on
the tray. Remember, you must have them cool quickly after
being coated, for if they do not, it is liable to make them grey
or streaked, and this is as important as working the chocolate.</p>

<p>It is best to lay these chocolates in boxes, with wax paper
between the layers, and keep them in a cool place. If you
lay them in the boxes carefully, they will not get scratched,
and will keep fresh for several weeks if kept in a cool place.</p>

<p>The slab you use for making the other candies cannot be
used for chocolate coating, because the chocolate will absorb
the butter which has been used to grease the slab, and it will
cause the chocolate to become rancid, if the bon-bon is kept
for a length of time. If you have a piece of marble about
twelve inches square, use that. If you have a large, heavy
platter, it will do just as well as a slab.</p>

<p>If you wish to make the chocolate bon-bons for your own
use, you can either use heavy wax paper to lay the coated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
chocolates on, or buy enough white table oilcloth, to cover the
under side of about six trays. Flat kettle lids, cake and pie
pans may be utilized for this purpose. Pieces of heavy tin,
cut to fit the shelves of your refrigerator, is about the best.
If you wish to make the chocolate bon-bons for profit, we
would advise you to equip yourself with conveniences for
the work.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PREPARING THE CHOCOLATE.</h2>


<p>This chocolate coating is very easily and quickly done,
and is exactly the same as all fine hand-made chocolates are
coated, and it is practically all done by girls; so you will have
no trouble in soon mastering it. Do not think it too difficult,
for it is so simple that a child can coat after these directions.</p>

<p>The methods for working the chocolate as illustrated,
are those used by a professional chocolate coater. Notice how
the chocolate is kept in the palm of the hand. These pictures
were taken after she had completed her work of preparing
the chocolate, and at the end of the day her hand is just as
free from chocolate as in the pictures.</p>

<p>Take the desired amount of chocolate; break it into
pieces, put them in a double boiler, and place it over the fire.
The heat of the water in the lower part of the boiler melts the
chocolate. Do not put on a lid or add water because moisture
or water that gets into the chocolate ruins it for chocolate
coating, but it may be used for cocoa or baking. In most
cases where the chocolate becomes too thick to coat with,
you can save it by adding cocoa butter, of which we will tell
you later on. Stir the chocolate occasionally while melting,
to help break up the lumps. As soon as the water in the
lower part of the boiler comes to a boil, turn the fire down
very low, so that the water does not boil and cause steam
to fly over the top of the chocolate, as that is sufficient to
thicken the chocolate. When it is about half melted, draw it
to the back part of the stove, and stir it until all the lumps
are dissolved. If you wish, you may test the chocolate with
the thermometer. Put the thermometer in the chocolate as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
soon as you set the double boiler off the fire. The required
degree is 125. If the chocolate is cooler than this, heat it until
it registers 125. If it happens to get a little too hot, lift
the upper part of the boiler out of the water for a few minutes,
but do not leave it out long. After you have a little experience,
it will not be necessary to test with the thermometer,
as you can tell with the hand when it is about the required
degree.</p>

<p>If you wish to coat a large amount of candy, it is best
to melt all the chocolate at the same time. It can be kept
the correct temperature by allowing it to stand on the back
part of the stove, or if you use gas for cooking, keep a simmering
flame under the double boiler. It is always necessary
to melt more chocolate than you expect to use, because you
must allow for that which cools around the edges, forms the
base on the slab, and clings to the sides of the kettle.</p>

<p>Orientals are the favorite chocolate candy and that is why
we use it in illustration. Three-fourths of a pound of chocolate
is the actual amount of chocolate needed to coat a
batch, but as you will put it on thicker, and use more when
you are a beginner, melt 1½ pounds.</p>

<p>You will learn from experience only, about how long it
is necessary to work and knead the coating before using it.
This is done for two purposes: One is, to break up the small
globules of oil in the chocolate to prevent them from being
spotted when coated, and the other is, to get your chocolate
thick enough, so it will not run off the cream after you lay
it on the oilcloth or wax paper. As you all know, if you dip
chocolate creams in thin chocolate, it runs off and forms a
base on the bottom of them.</p>

<p>If you should use a bowl and a pan of water instead of
double boiler, be very careful and do not get any water in it,
and also in pouring the chocolate out in order to work it, do
not pour it on a cold slab or platter, as that chills it too
quickly, but have it lukewarm.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 4</div>
</div>



<p>Pour on the slab 1½ pounds of the melted chocolate. Assume
the position of the hand as shown in figure 1; draw
the fingers through the chocolate with a “pawing” motion as
shown in <a href="#Fig_2-2">figure 2</a>. Each time that the fingers touched the chocolate
on the downward motion, close the hand, and lightly
squeeze the chocolate that is held between the fingers and the
palm. The chocolate flows through the fingers and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sides of the closed hand. Repeat this motion until the chocolate
is spread out over the slab, (it will only be a few times),
then encircle the outer edge, drawing the chocolate toward
the center, as shown in figures 3 and 4. The thin layer of
chocolate which remains is the foundation for the base which
keeps the chocolate within bounds. Never draw into the center
any of the chocolate that has become hard or that which
is getting stiff. It will spoil the entire lot. Continue the
“pawing” process, following it with the operations as shown
in <a href="#Fig_3-2">figures 3</a> and <a href="#Fig_4-2">4</a>. Occasionally take up a handful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
squeeze it as shown in <a href="#Fig_5">figure 5</a>. The chocolate in these illustrations
was allowed to become cold, so as to give you a
better idea how it should be done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;"><a id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/i-091.jpg" width="504" height="362" alt="fist of choclate oozing back onto slab" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5</div>
</div>


<p>When the chocolate is warm it is thin, but by the time
it has cooled enough it will be thick enough not to run off
the center. You must continue working the mass of chocolate
until the heat has all left it. There are several ways
of telling when it is cooled enough.</p>

<p>For a beginner, we might advise you to use the thermometer
until you have had a little experience. Slide the scale
with the glass on, out of the case, so that the chocolate will
cover all of the bulb, and after you have worked it for about
five minutes, stand the thermometer in the center of the mass
of chocolate until the mercury stops rising. If it registers
about 82, it is then ready. If it is higher, continue working
until it has reached the required degree. In cool weather
the chocolate may be cooled sufficiently in from five to eight
minutes, but in warm weather it may even take as long as
twenty minutes. After you have used the thermometer a
few times, you will know just how cool the chocolate should
be, and then you can get along without it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Another way to tell when the chocolate is cooled enough
is, when you have worked it for five or six minutes, and it
seems cold to the hand that is in it, simply dip the back of the
fingers of the other hand in the chocolate, and if it is in reality
cold, or you are sure the heat has all left it, then dip a piece
or two, and cool them quickly, and you can soon tell. The
chocolate has a high gloss, and retains the markings if it is
cooled sufficiently.</p>


<h3>COATING THE BON-BONS.</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;"><a id="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/i-092.jpg" width="505" height="350" alt="Dipping bon-bons into chocolate with chocolate covered hand" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6</div>
</div>


<p>When the chocolate has been worked as directed, take a
cream, (see directions “How to Mold in Cornstarch”), an Oriental
center, or a nut and drop it on the mass of chocolate near
the edge of the slab in front of you. Cover it thoroughly by
using the thumb and first three fingers, as shown in <a href="#Fig_6">figure 6</a>.
Pick up the cream from the mass of chocolate, wipe the side
and back of your hand on the slab (or use the back of a knife)
to clear it from the excess of chocolate which clings to it, otherwise
this will drip over the paper when you lay down the
cream. Smooth the chocolate covered cream by rolling it between
your thumb and fingers until it is evenly covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
chocolate. Hold it with the tips of your fingers as shown in
<a href="#Fig_7">figure 7</a>, and place it on the oil cloth at your right. In doing
this, do not hurry or you will have strings of chocolate over
the table and paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;"><a id="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/i-093.jpg" width="512" height="381" alt="Voila, chocolate covered hand holding chocolate covered bon-bon" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 7</div>
</div>

<p>In laying the bon-bons on the oil cloth, LAY THEM
DOWN SQUARELY. Do not allow them to slide or a base
will form, which you wish to avoid. It is essential that the
tray be level.</p>

<p>Coat the bon-bons as rapidly as possible so that it will
not be necessary to reheat the chocolate before you have finished.
If the chocolate is reheated, it must be worked again,
as in the beginning.</p>


<h3>ORNAMENTING THE BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>In ornamenting bon-bons it is necessary to have some
one help you. The ornament must be placed on each bon-bon
<b>as soon as coated</b>, before the chocolate is set. Your helper
can do this while you must continue with the work of coating.</p>

<p>A nut or silvered dragee, as shown in <a href="#Fig_8">figure 8</a>, may be put
on top as an ornament. Do not press the ornament on the
bon-bon, but place it lightly, otherwise it will form a base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>To acquire this skill in marking, begin by trying to mark
the coated nuts. Roast some almonds in the oven with the
skins on, which need not be removed when coating. English
walnuts or pecans may also be used. The thread of chocolate
is carried with the thumbnail across the top, as shown in figure
11. There is enough chocolate on the thumb, so that it is
not necessary to touch the coated nut as you do when you
mark the bon-bons.</p>

</table></div>

<p>After you have coated for some time and become an
expert, you can learn to make the pretty markings seen on
chocolate bon-bons, as shown in <a href="#Fig_9">figure 9</a>, which always distinguishes
the hand-coated bon-bon. After you have placed
the chocolate coated bon-bon on the paper, touch the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lightly with the chocolate covered middle finger. Carry the
thread of chocolate that lifts up with your finger in a circle as
shown in <a href="#Fig_10">figure 10</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Do not be discouraged with your work, if you do not succeed
the first few times. Many persons prefer the rough appearing
candies, because in their opinion they look more
“home-made.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS.</h2>


<p>When you coat begin by using the chocolate which is directly
in front of you, and keep this cleared space to wipe the
chocolate from your hand after you pick up the cream center
from the mass of chocolate.</p>

<p>When you have used about one-third of the chocolate,
sweep around the inside edge, as you did when working it, so
that you may keep the entire mass the same temperature.
Do this quite frequently.</p>

<p>Coating candies in the manner described here, your creams
will have no base on them whatever, and will be very glossy,
and not spotted in the least. If they are spotted after being
coated, it is probably because you did not thoroughly work the
chocolate, or because you worked in some of that around the
edge that was too cold. Never mind how much there is
around the edge of the slab, as none of it is wasted.</p>

<p>If they are not glossy, it is either because you commenced
coating them before your chocolate was cool enough, or allowed
it to get too cool, which would spoil the gloss, or did
not put them in a cool place soon enough after coating them
in order to set the chocolate.</p>

<p>When you are through coating, take your scraper and
scrape all the chocolate off the slab, and also with a knife
scrape it from your hand, and put it back in double boiler,
and you will find that there is not enough chocolate wasted
with which to coat one chocolate cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing necessary to put in this coating,
but simply melt it and handle as described. If the chocolate
is too thick to coat with, it is because you have allowed
some of the steam, or a drop of water to get mixed in it, and
you may then add a little melted cocoa butter to thin it a
little. Do not get it too thin; remember that.</p>

<p>In using milk chocolate, you will find that it is much
thicker than the sweet coating, and also, full of little lumps,
which will be broken and worked through by the time it is
cooled. If you wish you may add a very little melted cocoa
butter to this coating, about the time you start to work it.</p>

<p>The bitter-sweet coating you will use in making Orientals,
is thinner than most of the other coatings, and if you
wish to thicken it a little, simply add a very little XXXX
sugar to it, when you start to work it.</p>

<p>We will repeat again, that you must work the chocolate
as much as you possibly can before you begin to dip; for,
while it is absolutely necessary to have the chocolate cool,
or until the heat has all left it, before you begin to coat. <b>It is
essential to work the chocolate as much as possible, until it
is cool</b>, even if it takes fifteen to twenty minutes. Otherwise
your chocolates will be grey.</p>

<p>The secret in successful chocolate coating, is in working
the chocolate properly, having it cool enough before you begin
to dip, then cooling the dipped candies as soon as they have
been dipped.</p>

<p>Never lift the dipped chocolates off the boards or trays,
until they are set; you can tell this by lifting one piece off
the wax paper or oilcloth, and if the bottom is glossy, then
they are set.</p>

<h2>ORIENTALS</h2>

<p>The Finest Chocolate Cream Made.</p>


<h3>This is acknowledged by everyone to be the finest Italian
chocolate cream made, and when coated with the proper
coating, it is a delicious confection, with a very brittle coating,
and when broken open, the center is as smooth and soft as
whipped cream.</h3>

<p>We put this recipe last for the reason that you should
learn to do the other chocolate coating before attempting this.
The coating is done in exactly the same manner, except with
these it is necessary to handle them very quickly, and consequently
you must have a little experience in this line before
attempting these, but after making them once, we do not think
you will ever make the other different kinds, except for the
purpose of filling your Christmas boxes, when it is very nice
to have an assortment. With enough practice to enable you
to coat them nicely, and if you are so disposed, you will have
no trouble in selling all you can make at sixty cents per pound,
to private customers only, as there are very few stores in the
country where it is possible to purchase them. One reason
of this is, they are too delicate to stand being boxed up and
shipped around the country to the different dealers, and
probably be kept for months, as some candies are, before being
sold.</p>

<p>We tell you this to impress upon you how really fine they
are, and the possibilities of profit, if you expect to make candy
to sell. The formula is very simple, and known only to a very
few, but you must follow directions very closely and cook it
to the exact degree. The thermometer will do the cooking
accurately, and the other part is not difficult in any manner.
For the coating, it is best if possible, to get what is called a
Bitter-Sweet Coating. This may be purchased in any large
city, also of a great many candy manufacturers, or of any
candy supply house or chocolate manufactory. If it is not
possible to get the Bitter-Sweet Coating, you may make one
which is nearly as nice as the other, by simply getting the
pure unsweetened or bitter chocolate, which all confectioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
handle, and sweeten it partly with XXXX sugar (never use
granulated), in the proportion of one-fourth pound sugar to
two and one-half pounds chocolate, by simply stirring the
sugar in the chocolate after it is melted. If you should be
unable to procure any other kind of chocolate, you could use
the ordinary bitter baking chocolate, sweetened somewhat
with XXXX sugar, but do not use it if you can possibly avoid
doing so.</p>

<p>These creams should never be coated with a sweet coating,
but always a bitter-sweet of some description, as the intensely
sweet center, and the bitter coating, form a combination
that makes them delicious.</p>

<p>They are made in the following manner, and a batch this
size will use up about one pound of chocolate, but of course
it will be necessary for you to have more melted up for reasons
we mentioned before:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2½ pounds granulated sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful glycerine.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs.</li>
<li>6 drops acetic acid.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
<li>Good pint of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar and water in kettle, set on hot fire, stir until
dissolved, then put in the glycerine, continue stirring and
wipe down kettle same as for fondant, and when it commences
to boil add the acid, then cover the kettle until it steams well,
remove the cover, put in thermometer and cook to <b>exactly</b> 236,
then pour on moistened slab and allow it to remain undisturbed
until all the heat has left it, the same as you do bon-bon
cream. Now beat the whites of the eggs until dry, or will
stand alone, then pour them on top of the batch, add the vanilla,
and cream the batch in exactly the same manner as you
do bon-bon cream, working the eggs right into it. If some of
the syrup should be a little thick and not seem to mix with
the eggs well, just take the scraper or whatever you are turning
it with, and break the hard syrup a little, when it will
readily mix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course this will be thinner than bon-bon cream, and
will require more attention in order to keep it in a mass and
not allow it to spread all over the slab. It will be a little thinner
just before it commences to set, the same as bon-bon
cream does, and now turn it <b>very gently</b> in order to give it all
the chance possible, as this is the delicate point. Keep turning
it over and over <b>very slowly</b>, always working from the
edge, and gradually work it up in a mass until it will stand
alone and not spread any, and it is then done. About the only
trouble you will have in making these will be at this point.
The egg whites have a peculiar action on the cream, and sometimes
it sets very quickly and gets hard enough to handle
easily, and at other times it seems as though it never will set,
and even when it does, on such occasions it is very soft and
difficult to coat. Each batch you make will probably vary a
little from the other, owing to the peculiar nature of it, but it
will all come out the same when coated, and allowed to stand
awhile. When properly made, this cream at this stage is an
intensely white, rather fluffy mass, about the consistency of
a soft marshmallow, only it is very tender, and not tough as
they are. When creamed up, cut the batch in two after allowing
it to stand for three or four minutes in order to <b>set</b>
a little more, and to one-half of it work in some chopped English
walnuts by kneading them in with your scraper, and allow
the other half to remain plain; then cut both halves into several
pieces so as to allow the air to strike it as much as possible,
which has a tendency to dry it and make it easier to handle.
It is now ready to mould up, and must be done so at
<b>once</b>. Have a small dish with some XXXX sugar in it, take
a knife and cut off a small portion of the cream, and with
your fingers shape it up slightly into a ball, then as it will
probably be a little sticky, lay it in the XXXX sugar and turn
it over in order to get the sugar all over it, then lay it on wax
paper, and proceed in this manner until you get them all
moulded. The ones with nuts in should be made just a trifle
oblong, so as to distinguish them after being coated. In
moulding these up, remember that the <b>less</b> they are handled,
the easier they will be to coat, as handling them has a tendency
to make them softer. After they are moulded, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
best to turn them all over, as they lay on the wax paper, before
coating them, in order to allow the bottom to dry off a
little. These must be coated immediately after being moulded,
and the better way is to have someone mould them and you
coat them as fast as they are moulded. The person moulding,
will do so faster than you can coat them, and thus they will
be able to dry off a little by the time you are ready for them.</p>

<p>Coat them in the same manner as other chocolate creams,
but remember that it must be done rapidly, for you cannot
hold them in your hand but a few seconds, as they get too
soft, and will lose their shape and spread out after dropping
on the oilcloth.</p>

<p>They have a tendency to pop out, after the chocolate is
set, if there is a thin spot anywhere in the coating, but this
does not hurt them. They will be very soft inside, several
hours after being coated, and are best if eaten within a week
after they are made. If you should put them in boxes, it is
better to wrap each one separately in a small piece of thin
wax paper, as they are so soft inside. If one should break it
would run out and spoil the looks of the others.</p>

<p>The length of these directions may cause you to think
they are very difficult to make, but such is not the case, as
you will see after trying them, for the thermometer does the
most difficult part, it being necessary to cook them to the exact
degree. In moulding them, do not try to get them all
the same size or the same shape, as they look prettier made
in odd shapes and this sized batch will make about one hundred
ordinary sized creams.</p>


<h3>MAPLE ORIENTALS.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1¾ pounds maple sugar.</li>
<li>¾ pound granulated sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful glycerine.</li>
<li>6 drops of acetic acid.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs.</li>
<li>Good pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put both kinds of sugar and the water into a kettle, stir
till dissolved, add the glycerine, continue stirring and wipe
down kettle same as for fondant, and when it commences to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
boil add the acid, then cover the kettle until it steams well,
remove the cover, put in the thermometer and cook to exactly
238, then pour on a moistened slab, and finish exactly the
same as vanilla Orientals. You will notice that we tell you to
cook this to 238, while the vanilla Orientals are only cooked to
236. The reason of this is, that the maple sugar always has
a tendency to make candies softer than white sugar, and most
necessarily must be cooked to a higher degree.</p>

<h2>A FEW WORDS ON CAKE-BAKING</h2>


<p>This is not a cook book; but as it is intended principally
for ladies, we will include in it a few ideas we have in regard
to cake baking, and also a few recipes for refreshments to be
served when entertaining.</p>

<p>We are not advertising any particular brand of baking
powder, as we use none, neither are we advertising any particular
brand of flour. In place of baking powder, we use
cream of tartar and soda, and as all pure baking powder is
composed practically of nothing but these two ingredients
mixed with rice flour, they will, when used in the following
manner, give you the same results as baking powder, and
also prevent your cake from falling.</p>

<p>Always use winter wheat flour for cake baking. One
pound of pure baking powder is composed of one-half pound
cream of tartar, one-fourth pound of soda, and one-fourth
pound of rice flour. In all recipes that call for baking powder,
use just one-half as much cream of tartar as it calls for baking
powder, and one-half as much soda as you use of cream
of tartar; that is, if a recipe calls for two teaspoonfuls baking
powder, you simply use one teaspoonful of cream of tartar and
a scant half teaspoonful soda. In measuring soda, <b>always
level your spoon off</b>, and in cream of tartar, have it slightly
rounding. Always sift your soda with the flour two or three
times, and always put the cream of tartar in the eggs. If you
use only yolks, when beating them beat the cream of tartar
with them, but if your cake calls for the whites, then put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the cream of tartar and beat them until they are stiff. In order
to tell when your whites are beaten sufficiently, lift your
whipper or beater, turn it over quickly, and the whites that
lift with it should stand up perfectly straight, and if they do
this, your eggs are beaten sufficiently.</p>

<p>The heat of your oven has everything to do with successful
cake baking and you must be careful and not allow it to
get too hot. Your cake should first <b>raise</b> in the oven, before it
commences to brown on the top, if you wish to make a success
of it. If you follow the directions exactly as written here,
you need have no fear of your cake falling, from opening the
oven doors and looking at it at any time, or from jarring the
oven in any manner, as you may take any of these cakes out
of the oven when they are only <b>partially</b> done, shake them
around, then put them back in the oven, and they will raise
perfectly, providing your oven is not too hot, and you mix
these cakes exactly as we direct you. This may seem a rather
broad assertion, and shatter a great many ideas you now hold
in regard to cake baking, but it will only cost you the time
and trouble of making one cake to find out that this is correct.
We have done this with cakes repeatedly in order to convince
people it would not hurt them, and they would come out of
the oven as light and as perfect as any cake ever baked.</p>

<p>It does not make a particle of difference which way you
beat your cake, or whether you put all of the flour or milk in
at once or a little at a time, as some cake makers direct you
to, so long as you beat it <b>thoroughly</b>, which is a very essential
point. Always put all of the flour and milk in at once, as
it is much easier than adding a little at a time. If your cake
falls a particle, or fails to come out perfect in any way, the
fault <b>beyond a doubt</b> is with your oven, providing you have
followed the directions. A gas or gasoline oven is by far the
best for cake baking, as you are able to get the heat more regular
with them. If you will measure and sift your sugar on
a plate, then set it in the oven for just a few moments, until
it gets warmed through, you will find it will cream nicer with
the butter, as the heat in the sugar softens the butter.</p>

<p>You may take any cake recipe you have, and apply these
same directions in making it, using cream of tartar and soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in the proportions directed, follow other directions carefully,
and you will never experience any trouble with your cakes.</p>

<p>If you are much of a cake baker, this article alone is
worth a great deal to you, and if you never had much success
with your cakes, you will find it a very easy branch of domestic
science to learn, instead of a difficult one, as some
have led you to believe.</p>


<h3>ANGEL FOOD.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Whites of 11 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup flour.</li>
<li>1½ cup sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>1½ teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift your flour three or four times. If you have powdered
sugar, use it for this cake; if not, use granulated and sift it
two or three times. Add a pinch of salt to your whites of
eggs, beat them a little, then add the cream of tartar and beat
until stiff; then stir the sugar and vanilla into the beaten
whites, and in doing this always stir from the bottom, as it
keeps them fluffy, and do not stir it any more than is necessary.
Remember this in all cake recipes where you stir sugar
into whites of eggs. Now gently fold in the flour, and put
in pan and bake in moderate oven, and it will require about
forty-five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h3>GOLDEN CAKE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Yolks of 8 eggs.</li>
<li>1¼ cup granulated sugar.</li>
<li>⅔ cup butter.</li>
<li>⅔ cup sweet milk.</li>
<li>3 cups flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>1½ teaspoonful lemon extract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift the flour and soda together three times, and remember
in all cake recipes, in measuring <b>soda</b> to use <b>scant</b> measure.
Put cream of tartar in yolks and beat them stiff as possible.
Sift your sugar on a plate, warm it in the oven a little
and then cream it and the butter together thoroughly and add
the flavoring while doing this; add beaten yolks to this and
beat in well. Now add the milk and flour and beat it hard
for about two minutes, then bake in two layers and lay up
with white frosting. Have oven moderate and it will bake
in thirty or forty minutes. This cake is also very fine when
baked in loaf form, and in that, only use two and one-half
cups flour, making it otherwise just the same.</p>


<h3>DEVIL’S FOOD.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1½ cup sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup butter.</li>
<li>¾ cup sweet milk.</li>
<li>3 cups flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>2 squares of chocolate.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful soda.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grate your chocolate, and to it add half of the milk, and
set on stove and stir until dissolved. Then stir in half cup of
your sugar and set away to cool. Sift the soda in the flour
three times. Beat the yolks very stiff. Warm the remainder
of the sugar in the oven a little; then cream thoroughly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the butter, then add the beaten yolks to this and stir in well.
Add the cream of tartar to the whites of the eggs after beating
them a little and then beat until stiff. Add the remainder of
the milk to the chocolate and stir in well, and then pour it into
the creamed butter and sugar, add flour and beat very hard.
Then stir in the egg whites and bake in two layers and lay
up with Oriental frosting.</p>


<h3>SPONGE CAKE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 large eggs.</li>
<li>1½ cups granulated sugar.</li>
<li>1½ cups flour.</li>
<li>⅓ teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful lemon extract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks very stiff. Add pinch of salt to the whites,
beat a little, then add cream of tartar and beat stiff. Then stir
in gently the sugar and vanilla, and the beaten yolks, then fold
in the flour and bake in a very moderate oven. This makes a
delicious sponge cake.</p>


<h3>SUNSHINE CAKE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1¼ cup granulated sugar.</li>
<li>1 cup flour.</li>
<li>⅓ teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks very stiff; add pinch of salt to whites, beat a
little, then add cream of tartar and beat until stiff. Sift your
sugar once or twice, then add it and the beaten yolks to the
whites and stir in gently, adding the vanilla when doing this,
then fold in the flour carefully and bake in a moderate oven.
This cake is very fine to use in making Charlotte Russe, as
follows: cut it up in very thin strips, then cut the strips just
long enough to fit around the inside of the cup, then fill center
with the whipped cream as we direct you in recipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>BRIDE’S CAKE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 whites of eggs.</li>
<li>1½ cup sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup butter.</li>
<li>½ cup milk.</li>
<li>2½ cups flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift first, then warm the sugar as directed before, and
cream thoroughly with the butter and add vanilla while doing
this. If you wish, you may add a little violet flavoring, as it
improves it. Put the soda in the flour and sift three or four
times. Then add it and the milk to the creamed butter and
sugar and mix well. Beat the whites a little, then add the
cream of tartar and beat until stiff; then mix them with the
other ingredients, and bake in a deep pan in a moderate oven,
and will require from forty-five to sixty minutes.</p>


<h3>ORIENTAL ICING.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound sugar.</li>
<li>1 egg white.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful glycerine.</li>
<li>2 drops acetic acid.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook the sugar with just enough water to dissolve it to
236, and do this operation the same as directed in making
fondant or Oriental cream for centers, adding the glycerine
when the sugar is dissolved and the acid when it commences
boiling, and be sure and wipe down sides of kettle
and steam it. When cooked to 236 pour out on slab or
platter, which has been dampened a little, and allow it to get
cold; then beat your eggs white and put it on the syrup and
cream up the same as in Oriental creams, adding the vanilla
when you commence to cream it. When you see this is just
<b>commencing</b> to set or thicken a little, it must be put on the
cake, and done very rapidly. If you attempt to put it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cake too soon, it will run off, and if it should commence running
off, simply cream it up a little more before putting any
more on, and also if you should allow it to get too <b>stiff</b> before
putting it on the cake, it would make your cake rough looking.
There is just a certain point where you really should commence
putting this on the cake, and after trying it once, you
will have no difficulty in telling when you have creamed it to
the right consistency.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is beyond a doubt the finest icing made, in every
respect, as it is smoother than other icings, and also does not
get hard and chip off, as other icings do when you cut the
cake. It forms a slight crust on the outside, but next to the
cake it remains soft, and will keep nicely for about a week.
In using this on a layer cake, the better way is to ice your
top first, as the first icing you put on is much smoother than
the last, then use the last of the icing for the middle of your
cake, as that does not show. After making this icing once, in
this manner, we do not think you will ever attempt the other
icing which everybody makes. This amount will cover one
cake.</p>


<h3>CHARLOTTE RUSSE.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint very stiff cream.</li>
<li>4 egg whites.</li>
<li>1 cup sugar. (XXXX sugar).</li>
<li>Good teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the cream stiff enough to stand alone, and this cannot
be done unless you have very thick cream; add the sugar
and the vanilla to it and mix thoroughly; beat the whites after
adding a pinch of salt to them, until very stiff, then mix
them well with the whipped cream, and with a spoon, fill your
cups which have previously been lined with the Sunshine
cake, cut up as directed, or with Lady Fingers, split open.
This makes a delicious dessert, and putting a candied cherry
on top of each one, sets them off a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h3>ORIENTAL PUNCH.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Juice of 2 lemons.</li>
<li>Juice of 3 oranges.</li>
<li>6 to 8 drops of peppermint.</li>
<li>Green coloring.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the water, lemon juice, and orange juice together,
and add enough sugar to sweeten to suit the taste. Then
strain it and add enough green coloring to make it a very
pale green; then add the peppermint, which will give it a
peculiar flavor that is very fine.</p>

<p>Claret punch may be made in the same manner, only
leave out the peppermint and green coloring, and in their
place add enough claret to flavor and color it. Serve these
cold.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE SYRUP.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1¼ pound granulated sugar.</li>
<li>¼ pound cocoa.</li>
<li>1 pint hot water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix sugar and cocoa well together, then add the hot water,
set on stove, stir until it commences to boil, then add a
pinch of salt and stop stirring, and cook <b>exactly two minutes</b>
after it starts boiling. Set off the stove, and when cool stir
into it the vanilla. Then pour it into a glass jar and put away
until needed. This syrup is to use in making hot chocolate
or cocoa, and is done in the following manner: put a tablespoon
of the syrup in your cup, then put in two tablespoonfuls
of cream, and stir them together thoroughly, then fill
your cup with boiling water, and you have a cup of hot cocoa
which is very hard to beat, and is made as you see, much
easier than stopping to cook it each time, as by having the
syrup on hand, the only thing necessary, when you wish a
cup of hot cocoa, is to simply have some boiling water. A
little whipped cream put on top, after adding the hot water,
improves it very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>This recipe alone, to anyone fond of this drink, is worth a
great deal. If the syrup gets too thick at any time, thin it a
little with a syrup made of sugar and water. You may also
use it in making chocolate icing. It is also used in making
chocolate ice cream; and you use for this purpose, one-half
pint of the syrup to each gallon of cream, putting it in when
the cream is partly frozen.</p>


<h3>TABLE SYRUP.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pound glucose.</li>
<li>½ pound sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all this in a kettle, stir till it boils, then wash down
sides of kettle, and cook to about 218 or 220. Set in a cool
place, and do not disturb till cold. If it is a little too thick
when cold, add a little water. This makes a fine syrup and
with the thermometer, it can be made the same every time. If
it is allowed to cool without being disturbed, it will not sugar,
and will keep indefinitely.</p>
